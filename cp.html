<h1>contact policy</h1>
<p>these days, it seems like there are people on the internet who want to talk to me or engage with my tweets.
personally i can't understand this behavior - it seems very masochistic, but who am i to judge?</p>
<p>thing is, there are some things these people seem to do a lot that are really irritating or awkward or just
plain tiring. so i'm writing this as a list of guidelines and warnings for people who want to have positive interactions
with me or make a positive impression on me. <em>personally</em> i think a lot of this is just common netiquette,
but it bears repeating. and i do have my fair share of idiosyncrasies.</p>

<ol start="0">
	<li>rule zero: you don't have to follow me or engage with me! at all! ever! nobody is forcing you to! if your reaction
	to anything here is "ugh you are WRONG AND BAD," just close the tab and get on with your life.</li>
	<li>the most important thing to remember: i have fibromyalgia. typing is painful for me, so i'm usually pretty
	low-key and quiet and i'm not going to respond to something if it's not worth that pain to me.</li>
	<li>i don't use block lists (too many of my friends have illegitimately wound up on them), but i rarely hesitate to
	block people. if your account looks like a spambot, i'll block & report you for spam on sight. try not to fail the
	turing test!</li>
	<li>i don't like men. there are exceptions, like, i'm generally fine with queer men, but if you are male that makes me
	instantly suspicious of you and your motives.</li>
	<li>i appreciate direct communication. if you have something to say to me, say it. don't dance around the point or
	waste my time with filler or verbal noise.</li>
	<li>if i post something critical of men/cissexuals/straight ppl, please don't respond with "I KNOW RIGHT" if you are
	in one of those categories yourself in an attempt to earn yourself cookies or reassurance that You're Not One Of Them.
	instead, focus your energy on Not Being One Of Them.</li>
	<li>yes, literally all men.</li>
	<li>please be sincere. sarcasm is annoying and tiring.</li>
	<li>if you are going to say something to me, please first ask yourself "am i contributing something worthwhile?" i'm
	not interested in jokes ten other people have already made, verbal noise, and outdated memes.</li>
	<li>if you make a habit of willfully misinterpreting every thing another person says and tacking a ";)" on
	the end of your reply, fuck off. you think you're making yourself look clever and superior; in reality you're
	just coming across as a wanker. i have no time for people who lack the most basic communication skills.</li>
	<li>i will block people who disrespect sex workers on sight.</li>
	<li>verbal tics make me cringe.</li>
	<li>i talk about computers (mostly about how terrible they are) sometimes. this does not mean i'm a "nerd" or a "geek"
	or in any way part of that noxious little subculture. don't get buddy-buddy with me and expect me to enthusiastically
	geek out with you over something you assume i'm into. i don't like star trek.</li>
	<li>in general, please do not assume i share all your interests just because we happen to both be interested in a
	particular thing.</li>
	<li>no weeaboos. no teaboos. no cultural fetishists in general.</li>
	<li>it makes me very uneasy to be followed by programmers. the entire CS field is a reeking cesspool of male egotism,
	toxic masculinity, racism, white American ethnocentrism, and misogyny. if you're a guy in tech and you follow me,
	i would honestly appreciate some reassurance that you're not a posturing dudebro.</li>
	<li>i'm a linguist (by training, but sadly not by trade - yay fibromyalgia) and i will happily talk your ear off about
	Arabic sentence structure or topicalization strategies across primary language families or which phonologies i find
	the most spectacularly insane. that said:</li>
	<li>i'm a linguist. as in, i have academic training and extensive background in the formal science of linguistics.
	linguistics is not something like philosophy where you can have self-indulgent navel-gazing sessions 'til hell freezes
	over. it's a concrete academic discipline and if you have no linguistic background, i'm really not interested in hearing
	your pet theories. i will <em>happily</em> explain concepts to you and share what i know with you. i will <em>not</em>
	be appreciative of uninformed analyses or amateur rehashing of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and i will <em>not</em>
	put up with prescriptivism. if you whine about grammar, i will block you. if you whine about people "using words wrong,"
	i will block you. if you whine about emoji, i will block you so hard it'll make your head spin. prescriptivism is
	utterly antithetical to the science of linguistics and it is a manifestation of prejudice, usually racism, ageism, or
	misogyny.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>and this goes just as hard for SJ people who fly into a self-righteous rage any time somebody utters a word that
		they personally categorize as a slur. words are tools for communication, and adapting to other people's idiolects and reaching
		common grounds to be able to understand each other is a basic life skill. if you're so lazy you can't be bothered to work to
		understand people and use "slurs" as an excuse to turn your brain off, and you fly off the handle whenever a Brit says "twat"
		or a black person says the n-word, i'm not interested in talking to you.</li>
		<li>yes, there is such a thing as a slur. yes, it's a useful concept. no, SJ people have no fucking idea what it means. there isn't
		some magic List Of All Bad Things™ that you can use as a cheat sheet to instantly detect whether another person is Good
		or Evil. if a white man calls a woman a cunt because she won't sleep with him, it is in fact fair to assume he is a misogynist bastard
		who should be fired into the sun! but you know what? it is <em>equally</em> fair to assume he is a misogynist bastard if he just
		called her a jerk for the same reason! and if a Brit calls a male MP who voted for racist legislation a cunt, he's probably a decent
		bloke who shouldn't be mobbed by screaming American activists and accused of misogyny out of the blue. this is a magical thing
		called <em>context</em> and it is one of the cornerstones of interpersonal communication. slurs are contextual. they are an artifact
		of dialectical and idiolectical processes, not some Great Etymological Absolute. part of communicating effectively is learning how
		to communicate with another person 	in a way that will not hurt them, whether this means not saying "cunt" around a friend who
		was called that a lot by an abusive ex, or not mentioning spiders around a friend who's intensely arachnophobic and hates thinking
		about them. part of communicating effectively is being able to predict when a person will be upset by a certain word or topic so you
		can avoid it. that does not mean you can never speak of spiders again without being a Horrible Unsafe Person, and if you refused to
		ever say the word "cunt" again, you'd have problems speaking various Arabic languages where the word for "I was" is pronounced
		almost identically. <em>it is all about context.</em></li>
	</ol>
	<li>watching videos sets off my anxiety, and i have limited bandwidth for my internet connection. please don't link
	videos at me.</li>
	<li>don't DM me. i'm not comfortable with private conversations with the vast majority of people. this doesn't mean i 
	hate you or think you're sketchy or anything - it just has to do with past abuse and anxiety problems.</li>
	<li>generally, if you don't already have my phone number, don't try to contact me privately.</li>
	<li>please don't try to flirt with me. i'm really not into it, i almost never develop feelings for people over the
	internet, and it feels awkward and invasive - in fact it's only ever happened once. flirting in person is totally
	cool, but not on the internet, okay?</li>
	<li>my sexuality is a little bit fluid but there is a reason i ID as gay. if you're a man, i will not ever be into
	you. you are not the exception unless you are literally a bisexual italian supermodel, and they've got plenty more
	attractive people than me to fuck.</li>
	<li>if you have heroes, i probably hate them. mohandas gandhi was a misogynist, a pedophile, and a racist who stole credit for
	the liberation of india. john lennon beat his wife and stole her work. karl marx was a whorephobic, misogynist classist.
	the Founding Fathers™ were genocidal slavers. linus torvalds is a prick. the list goes on. MLK is literally the only
	exception that comes to mind.</li>
	<li>i'm really not into nostalgia. 99% of everything that has ever existed was shit and i want to help build a better,
	more modern culture, not exalt the past.</li>
	<li>if most of what you tweet about is video games or music, i will not follow you back. this doesn't mean i don't like
	you, just that your twitter feed bores me to tears.</li>
	<li>please don't expect enthusiasm from me. i'm a pretty reserved person and i don't get energetic or super emotive about
	things. and i find people who flail excitedly over every little thing that ever happens intensely tiring. by the same token
	i really have no time for fandom. there's a reason i quit tumblr.</li>
	<li>i do not like satire or parody. satire is a gaping art-shaped hole in culture and it is not worthy of celebration. if you
	are unable to enjoy anything sincere or take anything seriously, we have nothing to say to each other.</li>
	<li>in general i'm deeply ambivalent about a lot of SJ orthodoxy and as a marginalized, disabled poor person, i really do not like this
	idea that we are absolved of all responsibility by virtue of being Oppressed™. i'm really tired of the trigger-happy
	self-righteousness and ideological fixation of a lot of people in this community, especially because it so often hurts <em>other</em> marginalized people.</li>
	<li>it is possible to dislike something without thinking that thing is a supreme ultimate evil and that everybody who does like it are reprehensible baby-eating sickos. if i say i dislike or am not interested in something you like, keep this in mind.</li>
	<li>i'm willing to have friendly discussions with people. i'm NOT interested in arguing. i'm especially not interested in arguing with people who don't bother to research the meaning of the words they're using in context. if you try to redefine words or otherwise warp reality just so you can feel you're right, i will block you on sight because i've dealt with enough gaslighting for one lifetime.</li>
	<li>if you would describe your politics as one of: libertarian, Objectivist, or neoreactionary - gtfo. i have nothing to say to filth like you.</li>
