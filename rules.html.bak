<h1><em>##hashtag</em> code of conduct</h1>

<h2 id="do">"do"s</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="y1"><div>respect people's boundaries. if you're unclear on what someone's boundaries are, ask.</div></li>
	<li id="y2"><div>think before you type. verbal noise is not welcome. you don't need to personally react to every single thing other everybody else says, especially if it's just a "lol" or "lmao" without any followup. not everything you see is directed at you - this is IRC, not AIM.</div></li>
	<li id="y3"><div>contact the ops right away if you have any questions or concerns. we take people's comfort and safety very seriously, and we don't want anyone to feel like they can't approach us.</div></li>
	<li id="y4"><div>try to keep the high school drama to a minimum. if there's a regular in the channel you have issues with and you don't think you'll be able to play nice, don't join.</div></li>
	<li id="y5"><div>be prepared to identify yourself. this is not a place for randos or newbies, and if you have no identifiable connection with channel regulars, you'll be kicked and possibly banned.</div></li>
	<li id="y6"><div>in the words of Homeland Security: if you see something, say something. there are vulnerable people in this community and while the ops try to be proactive about interrogating and removing shitbirds, we can't do it alone. you all have the right to ask people to identify themselves. if you're not comfortable with confrontation and something seems off, contact an op right away.</div></li>
	<li id="y7"><div>be reasonable. we want to respect your boundaries, but if doing so is actively destructive or a serious burden on us, you will likely be asked to find a different community.</div></li>
	<li id="y8"><div>try to put relevant trigger warnings on content you post, especially links. there's no need to overdo it, but warnings for content containing sexual assault, graphic violence, psychological abuse, or visual depictions of nudity or spiders would be appreciated. please use the standard form "tw ‹subject›" to make it easier on people who want to use software filters, not nonstandard variants like "cw" or "cn."</div></li>
	<li id="y9"><div>we mostly speak english here, but feel free to use any language you like except lojban. we have regulars who speak swedish, finnish, spanish, french, arabic, and japanese, among others, and linguistic diversity is very important to us.</div></li>
	<li id="y10"><div>make sure your client's charset is UTF-8.</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dont"><div>"don't"s</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="n1"><div>don't ask or expect us to change our community norms for you. we're a very particular community and if you fit in, we're happy to have you, but your needs are not our priority. if you would prefer to interact with people here in a different context, feel free to create your own channel or invite people you know here to a channel you're more comfortable in.</div></li>
	<li id="n2"><div>don't send PMs without publicly asking first. you don't need to make a huge deal of it, something as simple as "hey <em>‹name›</em>, okay if i PM you?" is fine. and don't feel hurt or offended if people don't want to PM you.</div></li>
	<li id="n3"><div>don't invite people to ##hashtag without asking the community first, unless they're someone most of us already know and like.</div></li>
	<li id="n4"><div>don't start shit. if you feel you have been wronged by a channel regular, let the ops know right away, and consider avoiding the channel until we've dealt with the situation. don't directly attack that person or issue public denunciations on the channel. both of these are cause for summary banning.</div></li>
	<li id="n5"><div>don't piss off the ops. this is not a democracy or a forum for exercising freedom of speech. this is a gated community and we take the safety and comfort of our members extremely seriously. don't expect due process unless we're in a really good mood.</div></li>
	<li id="n6"><div>don't bite someone's head off for their first infraction. none of us can read minds, and if someone violates your boundaries unknowingly, they don't deserve to be chewed out for it.</div></li>
	<li id="n7"><div>don't whine at people for not speaking english. unless they're speaking lojban.</div></li>
	<li id="n8"><div>don't speak lojban. you'll be summarily lojbanned.</div></li>
	<li id="n9"><div>don't criticize people's grammar or spelling, unless they've specifically asked for help learning your native language - and even then, be respectful about it. linguistic prescriptivism is a great way to piss us all off.</div></li>
	<li id="n10"><div>don't use awaynicks.</div></li>
	<li id="n11"><div>don't log the channel. not only will you be banned forever, but republishing any conversations from <em>##hashtag</em> without the express permission of all participants is a crime under international intellectual property law.</div></li>
	
</ol>

<h2 id="ops">ops</h2>
<p><em>##hashtag</em> ops don't hide our status. if someone isn't marked as an op in your client, they aren't one. and op rights are not given out lightly. the only current ops are alfie and velartrill, and we currently have no plans to expand our ranks. you can reach us on IRC, and you can PM us without asking first if you have a complaint or other administrative matter to discuss. you can also reach velartrill on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">@velartrill</a>. velartrill is most likely to be available between 1800 and 0900 UTC.</p>

<h2 id="confres">conflict resolution process</h2>
<p>this isn't a formal policy and the ops reserve the right not to follow it if we believe there is a more appropriate way to resolve a particular complaint, but in general, this is how you can expect a complaint to be handled.</p>
<ul>
	<li>we will not share details with anybody not involved in the conflict until a decision has been reached, publicly or privately. we will not at any time share details about ongoing or past investigations that are not relevant to community cohesion and safety without consent of those involved.</li>
	<li>if the defendant is making you uncomfortable or not respecting your boundaries, we'll have a conversation with them. if they refuse to change their behavior, they will be banned. if they agree to change their behavior but don't follow through, they will be banned.</li>
	<li>if the defendant has harmed you or someone you know in real life, through violence, sexual assault, or psychological abuse, we will most likely not inform them of the complaint unless your credibility is severely in question. we will likely issue a preliminary ban and interview others associated with the defendant. if we find adequate reason to suspect the defendant, they will be banned permanently, and a public notice will be issued in the channel to warn others away from them. please note that we do take accusations of abuse extremely seriously, err on the side of believing the victim, and have banned longtime community members before.</li>
	<li>if we feel that you're making repeated spurious complaints or trying to fracture the community, you'll be banned. if we're feeling very, very charitable, we might warn you first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>bans</h2>
<p>if you're banned, that's it. you're done. no appeals will be heard. however, bans generally will not be permanent except where safety concerns exist.</p>
