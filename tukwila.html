<p style="text-align: right">(1) INT. A TRAIN - NIGHT</p>
<p>Tukwila, Washington. Not Seattle, of course; never Seattle -- never the bright lights and clean streets, always the airport city who never hesitates to spread her legs for the county seat’s rejects. That’s where the breaks began to squeal, shearing off us refuse not destined for the white marble and warm air of King Street Station.</p>
<p>The rain is pounding as the comforting rumble of the tired old train's engine finally fades. I finger the pill tin in my hands as the conductors begin their familiar bustle, trying to make a decision. But the answer is “yes,” of course; always “yes.” As if a junkie would know how to say “no.”</p>
<p>I grimace at the taste of bargain-bin opiates, tug my shoes on, and join my fellow passengers on the cold concrete platform. The crime passes unnoticed, as it always does. One of these days it won’t, and I think when that day comes, I might just be glad for the attention.</p>
<p>Then I see them. They’re hard to miss, red and green hair in the night, freshly dyed, almost glowing under the sterile gaze of the station lamps. I catch my breath, a thread of abstract plans and pleasantries drawn out over the telegram now suddenly joined to the tapestry of the physical.</p>
<p>Even through my drugged haze, my joints scream as I heft my luggage down the steps. I ignore it, as I always do. What else is there to be done? They spot me at last, they wave; my heart begins to race.</p>
<p>We embrace at the foot of the platform, our bodies speaking such a different dialect than at our last, awkward meeting, where so much was still unsaid. Overwhelmed, I turn away a kiss, and we hold each other tightly instead. Everything is more intense than I remember.</p>
<p>Unbidden memories. The last time I was touched like that--</p>
<p><em>This time will be different.</em></p>
<p>We pull away slightly, gaze into each other’s eyes. It’s hard to look away from eyes that gentle, a smile that mischievous, a face that beautiful. Here, shivering in the cold, whipped by wind and rain, the moment so long awaited finally passes.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, umbrellas perched on our shoulders, we set off into the night.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;margin-top:4em;" id="3">(3) INT. A HOTEL - NIGHT</p>
<p>I can’t abide romance novelists.</p>
<p>Sex, they’ll tell you, is all about pleasure. Tenderness and orgasm and soft kisses and, shall we say, private dicks nosing around in dark holes where they don't belong. It’s all sanitized and happy. The kind of sex you could picture Will Hays himself having, if you could even parse such a contradiction.</p>
<p>Truth is, there’s a darkness to us. All of us. You dig deep enough into the slightest, sweetest maiden and you’ll still find it -- that deep, fiery core of cruelty, tangled in an endless dance with love. So many of us try and separate them, scare away the shadow with floodlights and hide it under a thick shroud of lies, but you can’t have the one without the other. They’re fed by the same flame. Put out that flame, and you’ll turn into, well, Will Hays.</p>
<p>Some of us understand that. Some of us stoke that flame instead. That’s what sex is about, when it comes right down to it. It’s when we drop all the masks and lies that keep civilization creaking along, give in to our hunger for subjugation. Pleasure and pain are one and the same. Orgasm ain’t consequential.</p>
<p>The room isn’t silent. Nowhere is ever silent, Detective Bailey always used to tell me, back when I was a rising star on the force, still so sure good could win over evil, no idea what hell was fixing to rain down. Even silence has a sound, Bailey would say. The hum of a radiator, the patter of rain, the gentle swish of sheets, rapid breaths, my own pounding heart. Solving crimes is all about listening to the silence. Finding the little sounds -- red stains on a fresh mattress, bright flowers in an empty house -- that don’t quite add up, don’t quite fit in with the story everyone’s telling themselves. Silence is just a name for the sounds we don’t notice.</p>
<p>I still miss Bailey sometimes. She was a good apple, no matter all the shit they pinned on her after. That damn city didn’t deserve her. Least of all those crooks we called a force.</p>
<p>The old bedside lamp is our only light. Its dim glow traces the outlines of a face I can’t quite look away from, a grin that fills me with fear and anticipation both. Our lips touch again, and I exhale shakily. Who would have imagined <em>this</em> would go so far, back in that warehouse, at our first chance meeting as unexpected allies in the MacReady Affair?</p>
<p>Right now, I could almost thank Boss MacReady for all the bootlegging that chanced to lead me here.</p>
<p><em>Almost.</em></p>
<p>I gasp at the feel of their hands on my breasts. Not even the slightest hesitation. They know exactly how sensitive I am, and exactly how to use it against me. I can barely think now, pain driving out those higher sensibilities and replacing them with sheer instinct, fighting back not because I want to be free -- I don’t -- but because it’s all my body knows how to do.</p>
<p>It’s no use, of course. Those slim arms hold more strength than you’d think, certainly more than mine. Their hands are around my wrists now, pinning me to the bed until my struggling ceases. We kiss again, not like that sudden kiss beneath the bridge, but deeply, passionately, desperately, their teeth scraping my lower lip as they draw away, and then I’m on my back, crying out as they casually rip their fingernails across my tender skin.</p>
<p>But there’s a gentleness in all their cruelty. I realize quick that they can tell exactly how much I can take. I gave myself no way out, no escape hatch, and now I’m glad for it -- I’m going to get exactly what I need.</p>
<p>They falter when they see how much I’m shaking, draw back, ask if I’m okay. Words are beyond me. I respond with a tight hug, basking in the warmth of their body next to mine, and they understand. They don’t ask again, not even when I finally, blissfully, break down in tears.</p>
<p>I’ve been traumatized before, God in heaven knows. In my line of work, it'll always happen sooner or later. I know how my body reacts when it happens, I know where my mind goes. And this is that, right now. The shaking, the tears, the ragged breathing. But this time, it feels <em>right.</em> It feels <em>good.</em> And that brutal, raw high is a better one than any drug has ever given me.</p>
<p>I don’t want to let go of this moment.</p>
