<p>Tukwila, Washington. Not Seattle, of course; never Seattle — never the bright lights and clean streets, always the airport city who never hesitates to spread her legs for the county seat’s rejects. That’s where the breaks began to squeal, shearing off us refuse not destined for the white marble and warm air of King Street Station.</p>
<p>The rain is pounding as the comforting rumble of the tired old train's engine finally fades. I finger the pill tin in my hands as the conductors begin their familiar bustle, trying to make a decision. But the answer is “yes,” of course; always “yes.” As if a junkie would know how to say “no.”</p>
<p>I grimace at the taste of bargain-bin opiates, tug my shoes on, and join my fellow passengers on the cold concrete platform. The crime passes unnoticed, as it always does. One of these days it won’t, and I think when that day comes, I might just be glad for the attention.</p>
<p>Then I see them. They’re hard to miss, red and green hair in the night, freshly dyed, almost glowing under the sterile gaze of the station lamps. I catch my breath, a thread of abstract plans and pleasantries drawn out over the telegram now suddenly joined to the tapestry of the physical.</p>
<p>Even through my drugged haze, my joints scream as I heft my luggage down the steps. I ignore it, as I always do. What else is there to be done? They spot me at last, they wave; my heart begins to race.</p>
<p>We embrace at the foot of the platform, our bodies speaking such a different dialect than at our last, awkward meeting, where so much was still unsaid. Overwhelmed, I turn away a kiss, and we hold each other tightly instead. Everything is more intense than I remember.</p>
<p>Unbidden memories. The last time I was touched like that—</p>
<p><em>This time will be different.</em></p>
<p>We pull away slightly, gaze into each other’s eyes. It’s hard to look away from eyes that gentle, a smile that mischievous, a face that beautiful. Here, shivering in the cold, whipped by wind and rain, the moment so long awaited finally passes.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, umbrellas perched on our shoulders, we set off into the night.</p>
