<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale</i></p>

<p>first of all, i'm so sorry.</p>

<p>i'm sure you have a lot of questions.</p>

<p>what is an ansiglot, you might ask? i could tell you, but a principle rule of writing is ‚Äúshow, don't tell,‚Äù so i'd much rather <i>show</i> you.</p>

<p>so to discover the nature of this page firsthand, simply type the following command into any *nix terminal.</p>

<code>curl xn--rpa.cc/ansiglot</code>

<p>and i'll see you on the other side.</p>

[38;5;219mfirst of all, i'm so sorry.

i'm sure you have a lot of questions.

no, ‚Äúcurl‚Äù has [3mnot[23m suddenly attained the capability to parse html. the document you have downloaded is a ‚Äúpolyglot‚Äù - it contains code that can be interpreted in more than one format.

[1m[37mhow does it work?[38;5;219m[21m
the mechanism is fairly stupid. first the html document is sent, after which is a comment containing this payload. it embeds literal escape characters which are parsed as ANSI escapes by the terminal. first, it sets the background color (8-bit color is so limiting!). then it clears the screen, wiping out the HTML, and begins sending the text of the document.

[1m[37mwhat are the limitations?[38;5;219m[21m
plain text is plain text. this document has no way to interrogate the terminal and thus cannot do any advanced layout. no @media queries here.

[1m[37mshould i do this?[38;5;219m[21m
[1;3;4;5mNO.[21;23;24;25m

[1m[37mWHY???[38;5;219m[21m
the full documentation for this package is maintained as a texinfo manual. if the info program is properly installed at your site,

depending on your shell, this next bit might fuck it up a little.
 
sorry about that.

(an [37;1mecho -e "\e[0m"[38;5;219;21m should fix it.)
