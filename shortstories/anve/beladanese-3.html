<h1>Speaking Beladanese, Chapter III</h1>
<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (@<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">velartrill</a>)</i></p>

<p>Time to take a well-earned break from grammar and focus on some nouns and pronouns. So
far, the only pronoun we've learned is <i>is</i> [is], which is one way of talking about yourself.
But <i>is</i> has a dark secret: it can only be used between certain people!</p>

<p>Belad has a strict distinction between slaves and freefolk, as well as between women and men,
and this is very evident in its language. Slaves are expected to maintain a certain sort of decorum
in how they speak, and using the wrong pronoun, whether you're free or a slave, can cause all sorts
of trouble. <i>Is</i> can only be used when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You're a freewoman talking to another freewoman in your family.</li>
	<li>You're a freewoman talking informally to a friend who is also a freewoman.</li>
	<li>You're a freewoman talking to a slave you want to show particular respect.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Men can't use <i>is</i> at all, because Beladanese has gendered first-person pronouns! The male
first-person pronoun is <i>cuala.</i> Let's practice some sentences from a male perspective.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I am fashionable. <div class="answer">Cuala cardastache.</div></li>
	<li>My uncle fucks goats. <div class="answer">Ramma te tira cuala cha gabra.</div></li>
	<li>My trees are on fire. <div class="answer">Panchem cue cambe cuala.</div></li>
	<li>My uncle is on fire. <div class="answer">Puenche te tira cuala.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Men always use <i>cuala</i> between each other, regardless of status.</p>
<p>Now, what about when women are talking to men? Or to women they aren't close to? Here's
some examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A freewoman talking to another freewoman she does not know uses the respectful pronoun
	<i>asmari</i> to talk about herself.</li>
	<li>A freewoman talking to a female slave normally uses <i>enna</i>, but may use <i>is</i> or on
	rare occasions <i>asmari</i> to show particular respect.</li>
	<li>A freewoman talking to a member of a ruling clan, a priest or inquisitor of the High Church, or
	the Assembly in Rosamár uses <i>inochandi</i>, a very submissive pronoun.</li>
	<li>A freewoman of a city's ruling clan will use <i>is</i> when speaking to women from other clans.</li>
	<li>A female slave will use <i>inochandi</i> when speaking to a freewoman, <i>asmari</i> when speaking
	to other slaves and men, and <i>is</i> when speaking to friends.</li>
	<li>A freewoman speaking to a male slave uses <i>iranda</i>.</li>
	<li>Female priests of the High Church always use <i>asmari</i> for everyone, even male slaves, when acting in an
	official capacity.</li>
	<li>Inquisitors of the High Church, regardless of gender, use <i>enna</i> when speaking to most people, and <i>iranda</i> when
	interrogating someone.</li>
	<li>People will often use <i>iranda</i> or <i>enna</i> when angry, regardless of normal social boundaries.
	Young people may use <i>inochandi</i> in a mocking way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be thought of as a continuum of self-aggrandizement. Ranked from most-submssive to least, they are
<i>inochandi, asmari, is, enna,</i> and <i>iranda</i>. The rules for men are much simpler.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A freeman speaking to a freewoman in his own family or a female slave will use <i>ascuala</i>.</li>
	<li>A freeman speaking to a freewoman outside his family will use <i>ascarna</i>.</li>
	<li>A male slave will use <i>ascarna</i> with everybody but friends.</li>
	<li>A man speaking to any other man or to a friend will always use <i>cuala</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! Let's try some practice.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A woman is walking home from inspecting her mother's holdings. A slave tries to sell her a newspaper,
	and refers to herself as <i class="answer">inochandi</i>. When the woman responds, she uses
	<i class="answer">enna</i>.</li>
	<li>A mildly annoyed woman refers to herself as <i class="answer">enna</i> after another freewoman accidentally
	trips her. Apologizing effusively, the perpetrator refers to herself as <i class="answer">inochandi1</i>.</li>
	<li>A slave is outside a house and sees a freewoman about to fall from a ladder. When she catches the woman,
	she refers to herself as <i class="answer">inochandi</i>, but the freewoman uses <i class="answer">asmari</i>
	to show her gratitude.</li>
	<li>A woman goes to a brothel with some friends. She uses <i class="answer">is</i> to talk about herself.</li>
	<li>A freewoman furiously denounces a rival clan to their face, and uses <i class="answer">iranda</i> to refer to
	herself.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's enough for pronouns right now, don't you think? Let's finish off this chapter by practicing some new
vocabulary.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>te fena</b> sister</li>
	<li><b>te tama</b> brother</li>
	<li><b>bosta</b> to have</li>
	<li><b>tamande</b> to steal</li>
	<li><b>te bostagan*</b> slave</li>
	<li><b>te cambescan</b> forest</li>
	<li><b>te tig</`b> boy, son</li>
</ol>
<p>*Any word that ends in "(a)gan" doesn't obey the normal stress rules! This is a leftover from Old Beladanese
which had a much more complicated stress system. Basically, the "(a)gan" suffix doesn't count for stress calculation
like "(a)che" does, so work out what the stress would be if it wasn't there - in this case, BOS-tagan [ˈbos.ta.gan].</p>
<p>From now on, in exercises, we'll specify the gender of whoever is speaking as the Beladans would perceive it.
We'll also try to give some hints about formality, but English is spoken by people with very different ideas of
social hierarchy than the Beladans, so don't feel bad if you can't guess which level of formality is meant.</p>
<ol>
	<li>(f) My brother's stealing a slave, ma'am. <div class="answer">Tamande te tama asmari te bostagan.</div></li>
	<li>(f) The thieving boy is in the forest. <div class="answer">Ramma te tamande tig te cambescan.</div></li>
	<li>Iranda bosta te gabra. <div class="answer">I have the goat.</div></li>
	<li>Ascarna cardastache. <div class="answer">I am fashionable, mistress.</div></li>
	<li>(f) Slave, I'm on fire! <div class="answer">Enna puenche!</div></li>
	<li>(m) I'm fucking an elf, ma'am. <div class="answer">Ascuala parna te hali.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Don't miss the next chapter, where we'll talk about negatives and second-person pronouns!</p>
