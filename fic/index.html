<h1><a href="../">ʞ</a> / fiction</h1>
<p>note that none of my serials are ever really “finished” — i don't exactly <em>do</em> endings, so these stories are all permanently under construction.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="./spirals/index.html">Spirals</a></b>, a hard-SF social-fiction space opera with many different ongoing serials, and my primary focus as a writer.</li>
	<li><b><a href="./axis/index.html">Axis</a></b>, an expansive fantasy series that is if anything even smuttier than Spirals. certified Problematic®. features sex-crazed drow, noble warriors with more honor than sense, bickering aristocrats, labor power, crises of faith, violent ethnonationalism, aggressive mission creep, and the contractually obligate angsty teenage vampire romance. (those ideas and settings worth preserving from my older Anve series, which I have since abandoned, have been reworked into this setting.)</li>
	<li><b><a href="./an6/index.html">Approved News 6</a></b>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/approvednews6">thing i'm actually paid for</a> but don't really give a shit about. i wrote some long-form stories anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>if you want to read these stories offline, you can <a href="ebooks.tar.xz">download an archive of ebooks</a> in EPUB format. note that these ebooks may not always be as up-to-date as the online HTML versions.</p>
<p>there’s finally an <a href="../feed.atom">atom feed</a> available for those who want to follow this site from a news reader, getting updates more frequently and conveniently than from my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/velartrill">newsletter</a>. the feed only catalogues the fiction updates because that's most of what i write and all of what i care about, and also so that your escapism need not be interrupted by dreary political essays i still occasionally feel irrationally compelled to publish on the state of our rapidly disintegrating world. <strong><em>enjoy.</em></strong></p>
