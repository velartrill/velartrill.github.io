<p>there’s finally an <a href="../feed.atom">atom feed</a> available for those who want to follow this site from a news reader, getting updates more frequently and conveniently than from my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/velartrill">newsletter</a>. the feed only catalogues the fiction updates because that's most of what i write and all of what i care about, and also so that your escapism need not be interrupted by dreary political essays i still occasionally feel irrationally compelled to publish on the state of our rapidly disintegrating world. <strong><em>enjoy.</em></strong></p>
