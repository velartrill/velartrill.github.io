<h1>You’re fun when you’re angry</h1>
<div class="byline">a short story by Lexi Summer Hale</div>

<p>“You’re fun when you’re angry,” said Hana, propping serself up on an elbow and stroking my stomach. “Remind me to piss you off more often.”</p>

<p>“You’re evil,” I gasped, panting.</p>

<p>Hana giggled, reached up, and pinched my nipple. “Quit it!” I squealed, rolling over and burying my chest in the sheets.</p>

<p>“Make me!” Hana pounced on me. I struggled but se forced me onto my back and pinned my arms to the side. “You’re gonna have to work on those muscles if you ever wanna be a decent tackle,” se teased.</p>

<p>“Your FACE is a decent tackle,” I muttered. Hana bit my cheek. “Ow!”</p>

<p>“What have I told you about lame comebacks?” se chided, pressing ser knee between my legs.</p>

<p>I wrenched my arms free and shoved sim onto ser back. “Your FACE is a lame comeback,” I said, grabbing ser wrists and trying to hold sim down. Hana giggled and pushed me off serself with infuriating ease. I rolled to ser side and grabbed sim around the neck from behind with both arms, my head buried in ser hair.</p>

<p>“Get off!” Hana reached around and slapped my bottom.</p>

<p>“Mmmph,” I said, nipping ser earlobe. Se squeaked.</p>

<p>“You little shit!”</p>

<p>“Your FACE is a —” Se knocked me loose with an awkward foot to the stomach, and pinned me again, ser face inches from mine, breathing hard.</p>

<p>“You’re so getting punished for that,” se hissed, and pressed ser lips firmly against mine. I gasped as se drew ser teeth back across my lower lip and gently pulled away.</p>

<p>“All you’re doing is encouragi—” I began, and yelped as I felt ser teeth on my breast. “Aah! Dammit, Hanaqeshra, you— I’m going to—” Ser teeth pressed against my nipple and I broke off into a squeal.</p>

<p>“You’re going to what? I’m listening,” se purred, and forced me onto my stomach, easily pinning both of my wrists with a single hand. Fucking hoverball tackles.</p>

<p>“You — your FACE is—”</p>

<p>“You really are a glutton for punishment today.” I yelped as se smacked my bottom, hard. “Go on, keep at it. I can keep going all afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You can’t even imagine what I’m going to do to you,” I gasped, blushing. Thwack!</p>

<p>“You have another meeting tomorrow, I bet,” Hana continued playfully. “You’ll be sitting down for quite a while, won’t you?” Se let the implied threat hang in the air.</p>

<p>“Have... have you ever seen Imunorai nipple clamps?” I growled. “Because I know someone who can get me a pair and one morning you’re going to wake up w-with— aah!” I moaned as se expertly massaged my clit.</p>

<p>“Making you squirm is going to be my favorite part of this visit, I think,” said Hana, stroking my back. I tried to wrestle my arms free but to no avail. “Which says a lot since we’re finally going to get a chance to take down the Itaninnai Sunblazers.”</p>

<p>“They are going to whoop your ass,” I taunted. “Ow!”</p>

<p>“Do you really think you’re in any position to talk about asses getting whooped?” said Hana gently.</p>

<p>“This was not how it was supposed to go,” I mumbled.</p>

<p>“You figured you’d be the one spanking me? So cute!” Hana squeezed my neck gently. “When have you ever managed that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been working out,” I muttered.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen better muscles on a Merlydian blood-rat.” Hana raked my back with ser fingernails. I arched my spine involuntarily. “You spend too much time in low-grav. Makes you soft.”</p>

<p>“I like lo-grav!” I protested.</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m not complaining.” Hana kissed the back of my neck. “I like soft. Soft is <em>fun.”</em></p>

<p>“Mmph,” I mumbled.</p>

<p>“Soft is adorable when it tries to fight back.”</p>

<p>“Imunorai. Nipple. Clamps,” I growled.</p>

<p>Se giggled. “Careful, are you sure you want to give me ideas?”</p>

<p>“Frghl.”</p>

<p>Se pushed me onto my back again and kissed me, taking my wrists gently but firmly in both hands. “I missed you, Sumath.”</p>

<p>“Missed you too, you little shit.” I nuzzled ser cheek.</p>

<p>Se squeezed my wrists and let go, gently massaging my breasts. “I’m sorry I haven’t been in touch much. It’s been hectic with the big change in the playoff schedules.”</p>

<p>“I heard about that. Sounded like a lot of people got screwed over.”</p>

<p>“Yeahh.” Hana sighed. “I think it was the right call. There’s a lot of stuff gets bunched up at the end of the cycle, and it’s not great to have sports interfere with that. But it did throw off a lot of peoples’ plans for this cycle. A couple big names just up and flounced. Can’t really blame them.”</p>

<p>“How ’bout you?”</p>

<p>“Ahh.” Hana shrugged. “You know me.”</p>

<p>“Hana? What’s up?”</p>

<p>Se rolled over onto ser back. “I don’t know, Sumath. Everything’s... okay. I’m... okay.”</p>

<p>“Somehow it sounds like okay isn’t very okay.”</p>

<p>“Fuck, I don’t know, babe.” Hana stared at the ceiling. “When I’m home it’s just... same old, same old, y’know? Karaqista... I mean, it’s a thalora world.”</p>

<p>“Is that a problem? You grew up there.”</p>

<p>“Sure, yeah, but... I mean I spend so much time out in the Thalisa. All my mpariseata are offworld. I probably spend more time on other planets than with my ashtisa. This culture out here is the one I’m part of, Sumath.”</p>

<p>“It’s that different out here?”</p>

<p>“You grew up on a pure Thalisan world, right?”</p>

<p>“Orbital, but yeah. Settled in the Second Expansion. Old as butts.”</p>

<p>“Karaqista has only been Thalisan since the Great War. There are still crumbling imperial cities in some places. Hell, most people still identify with a binary gender.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never understood that custom.”</p>

<p>“Shit, you would hate it.” Hana laughed. “You wouldn’t fit in at all. It was fine for me, I was totally girly and it was never a problem, but it boxes most people in. Mean thing to do to people.”</p>

<p>“You’re that disconnected from the Karaqistai now?”</p>

<p>Hana suddenly looked tired. “This is hard shit to deal with, Sumath. I love Sasheluir, they’re my ashtisa, but… but I can’t pretend we understand each other anymore.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.” I squeezed ser thigh. “I can’t claim to understand what you’re dealing with, but I want to be here for you however I can.”</p>

<p>“You’re good at that.” Hana rolled over and kissed me. “Sometimes I wish we could just get our own ship. Run a hoverball league on board. Maybe set up our own ashtisa.”</p>

<p>“I could try to get ship-licensed. I mean, I’m already a good pilot. Picking up command... it’d take some studying, but—”</p>

<p>“You’d actually do that?” Hana laughed. “Fuck, Sumathaqri, you are too good to be true.”</p>

<p>“I have an mparisea with her own ship, actually. Maranqura. Se—‘she’ I guess I should say, she’s from Derosdesha and still uses their genders. She could probably give me some tips.”</p>

<p>“You have an mparisea with a ship? You never told me!” Hana slapped my thigh in mock outrage.</p>

<p>“I guess it never came up. I haven’t seen her in a while. I think she’s been busy running errands for the task forces. I used to pilot for her.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to have to introduce us someday.”</p>

<p>I smiled. “If you like. I don’t think Maran’s quite your type. Very... quiet. Cerebral.”</p>

<p>“How’d you two get along then?”</p>

<p>“Believe it or not you haven’t seen every side of me. —Hey!” Hana grabbed me and pushed me onto my stomach.</p>

<p>“Nope,” she said, tracing a spiral on my back with her fingernails. “I’m pretty sure I’ve seen these sides of you too.”</p>

<p>“Fnny.” I mumbled, pulling myself back around. “Thing about Maran is she… I don’t know. She’s too quiet. Spends a lot of time in her own head. I think the best thing about us was I helped her stay… engaged with the world. Pulled her out of her loops of scheming.”</p>

<p>“Do you two…?”</p>

<p>“Nah, I don’t think she’s really into sex. I mean, we’ve been intimate, but not like this.”</p>

<p>“I’m never gonna understand those people.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, it was enough for me.” I smiled. “Maran… she isn’t a very physical person. And she doesn’t spend a lot of time in the nsheth. Or the mpare, honestly, altho more there than here. I remember the first time I touched her she just... flinched. And gave me this odd look, and then really hesitantly touched my cheek. I… don’t think she has a lot of human contact.”</p>

<p>“Aw.” Hana pouted. “That’s kinda sad.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I don’t think she realizes exactly how big an effect it has on her.”</p>

<p>“You always did go for the mournful, troubled types.”</p>

<p>I punched sim in the shoulder. “You’d think she was cute too.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can all cuddle up in bed sometime.” Hana tickled me. I squirmed and grabbed the blanket.</p>

<p>“Eee!” I shrieked as she slipped her hands under me and tickled my stomach.</p>

<p>“You are adorable when you’re squirming.”</p>

<p>“Your FACE is—” was all I got out before Hana had me in a chokehold.</p>
