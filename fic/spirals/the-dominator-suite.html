<h1>The Dominator Suite</h1>

<div class="byline">An excerpt from <em>Modern Sexuality</em>, a twice-cyclic publication of the Itannina Psychology Forum</div>

<p>Kink in Thalisan space faces a couple of unique problems. Most citizens are cybernetically augmented to the point where it's trivial for them to just shut off pain or other noxious sensations that are usually the focus of S&M. Worldspaces are another problem: they can be an easy escape from a scene, and play taking place in worldspaces can be trivially escaped since the virtual environment is completely controlled by the users.</p>

<p>Some users don't mind these limitations, but they're a pain (& not the fun kind) for more hardcore kinksters. To this end, the Cybernetics Club of the Immunora shalisa developed a package of software known as the Dominator Suite, which enables varying degrees of control of a submissive partner's cybernetics based on pre-negotiated access protocols. The original form of the package was a simple hack that shut off voluntary control of cybernetic systems, but once the idea's full potential was realized, it was rapidly developed into a complex system of remote control and "digital rights management," to borrow Imperial parlance.</p>

<p>To use the system, the package must be installed on the cybernetics of both the controllers and receivers. The receiver then designates which functions a given controller may access, and activates the package. While the package is active, an authorized control may access the receiver's cybernetics and issue commands. For safety reasons, the suite's control program itself cannot be locked out except in the presence, remote or physical, of a controller, altho sketchy patches exist to enable self-bondage. These are emphatically not endorsed by the Immunora Cybernetics Club.</p>

<p>As of v972, the features of the DS include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Selective lockout.</b> Most capabilities of cortical implants can be individually locked out, from
     exiting or modifying a worldspace to communication in general.</li>
	<li><b>Total lockout.</b> The submissive partner is effectively rendered a baseline for the duration of
     play.</li>
	<li><b>Sensory stimulation.</b> The suite can leverage the relatively new API for the sensory stimulation
     capabilities previously only available thru worldspaces, allowing a dominant
     to induce sensations of touch, pain, pleasure, or any other supported sense
     remotely.</li>
	<li><b>Hypervisor mode.</b> All actions undertaken by the submissive must be authorized by a controller
     thru asymmetric-key encryption. Popular in total power exchange relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>Early versions of the suite were controversial as they involved exploits to work around kernel- and hardware-level "emergency exit" functions meant to protect a user and allow emergency shutdown in the event a glitch trapped them in a worldspace. After extremely heated negotiations with the Conclave Cybernetics Task Force, a compromise was reached where the base Thalisan OS and hardware would be modified to allow suspension of emergency exit functionality but only with a user-specified time limit.</p>
