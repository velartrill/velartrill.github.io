<h1>Twilight</h1>
<div class="byline">from a serial by Lexi Summer Hale</div>
<p>“What in all Haven is that idiot doing in there?”</p>
<p>The guard jumps at the sound of my voice, turning quickly to face me and curtseying awkwardly. Years go by but that never gets any less satisfying. “M-madame!” she exclaims. “Beg pardon, madame, but—”</p>
<p>Another scream reaches my ears, barely muffled by the layers of soundproofing. “Pull her out,” I growl. <em>“Now.”</em></p>
<p>Pigeon looks baffled as she’s led out of the tiny interrogation cell, galvanic wand still in hand, but her bafflement quickly turns to surprise, then fear as her gaze falls on me.</p>
<p>“Madame Vizier!” she exclaims, offering me a timid curtsey. I ignore it.</p>
<p>“What in all fuck do you think you’re doing?” I close range as aggressively as I can manage, motioning the guard to shut the door. “I have not in my entire career seen such <em>farcical</em> incompetence even from <em>men!</em> I cannot <em>believe</em> the life of such a vital asset has been placed in your clumsy fucking hands — do you mind explaining what you thought you were doing before I write you up for a lashing?”</p>
<p>“Mistress Raven—” the guard begins, glancing back and forth in confusion between the two of us. I silence her with a glare.</p>
<p>“Madame,” Pigeon squeaks, “I— I was simply conducting her sixty-third interrogation session, as scheduled and per protocol—”</p>
<p>“Per protocol my <em>ass!</em> Did <em>any</em> of you people pay attention to even five minutes of your training?”</p>
<p>“I— I don’t understand, I didn’t—”</p>
<p><em>“She was playing you.”</em> I aim an accusing figure at the silhouetted figure visible through the one-way window. “Like a goddamn <i>pai ĉiņ,</i> if I’m any judge!”</p>
<p>“P-playing me? H—”</p>
<p>“Thank merciful fucking God Lark at least had the sense to report this to me. How much did you give her? What did you let slip, Pigeon?”</p>
<p>Pigeon’s face hardens. The mention of Lark had exactly the intended effect. Workplace rivalries among your subordinates are so important to nourish.</p>
<p><em>“Give her!?</em> I was interrogating <em>her,</em> not the other way ’round—”</p>
<p>She yelps as I slap her across the cheek. “You wretched, insubordinate creature — are you seriously unacquainted with the concept of reverse interrogation? Heavens preserve our thousand suns; God knows you lot aren't going to. Whatever are they even teaching you these days? Were you apprenticed to a tax collector by mistake!?” I rub my forehead, squeezing my eyes shut. “No, no, you know what, just— just go. Both of you. I’ll deal with this personally.” I snatch the galvanic wand from her hand, brandishing it at her. “This is what I get for letting a girl do a woman’s job. Go. <em>Go!”</em></p>
<p>The two confused, angry, and terrified operatives practically flee down the dark, cramped hallway, and I breathe a quiet sigh of relief. I fumble in my pockets for my keyring and unlock the cell door with a trembling hand.</p>
<p>The woman inside is already painful just to look at even from behind, where her battered body is only a black outline against a brilliant white. And that's before I cross the room, behind the blazing luminator shining in her eyes, reducing her captors to dark, ominous shapes and casting stark shadows of the manacles that dangle from the ceiling, gripping her wrists high above her head. As I take in the full extent of what’s been done to her, even I can’t help but wince.</p>
<p>Starvation has left her ribs protruding, the skin of her waist stretched taut against the bones beneath. Her unclothed frame is marred by so many cuts and bruises she could almost pass for a high courtier if the marks weren’t so artless and vulgar. Red marks dot her exposed crotch and breasts, galvanic contact points from sustained-current torture — a trick we picked up from her people, ironically enough. A good one, too: it takes no effort to use, causes the most excruciating sort of agony imaginable and still leaves prisoners fit for work. Her cheeks are gaunt, her bright green eyes heavy-lidded. She says nothing, but the faint flickers of motion from beneath her eyelids and the faintest shift in her expression both tell me she’s sizing me up. Even now, still calculating. I can’t help but admire the girl for that kind of cold-blooded professionalism.</p>
<p>She looks so small, vulnerable, and fragile that it’s hard to believe the heavy titanium-alloy manacles and reinforced concrete ceiling are necessary to keep her from breaking free and killing me with her bare hands before I could even act.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this to yourself?” I ask her. “You know there’s only one way out of this cell. There’s no point in dragging it out — all you’re doing is buying yourself more pain and suffering. No rescue is coming. You know that by now. What could you possibly hope to gain? What is left to you but the hope of a quick death?”</p>
<p>The girl’s voice is dull, accent undisguised, but I can still hear the faintest note of spite. <i>“Anuarash des risit, uastahin.</i> Beat me, shock me, cut on me, rape me all you want. It doesn’t matter. <i>Randasit pas uarat.”</i></p>
<p>I step closer into the light, close enough she can see my face, and with a casual motion stab the galvanic wand into the listener deck affixed to the restraint frame. A sputter and crackle later, the reel of tape stops moving, the recorder rendered useless. I toss the wand across the room. <i>“A hal nare iena tami?”</i> I respond quietly, gentling my voice. <em>And why is that?</em></p>
<p>That gets her attention. Her eyes open wide, and she stutters incoherently for a few moments. Good. All those years weren’t a wild <i>pien şai</i> chase after all.</p>
<p><i>“H-hal— hali narit— hali iufit— Ranuira parenan!?”</i></p>
<p>“Only a bit,” I answer, switching back to my native tongue. “What I’ve been able to cobble together from fragmentary sources. It’s been a hobby of mine. Don’t worry, the unit doesn’t even know that notebook of mine exists. There’s no reason they ever need to.”</p>
<p>“What the fuck is this? What are you trying to accomplish, <i>uastash?” Uastash</i> this time, not <i>uastahin.</i> Despite herself, her tone has softened already. Progress.</p>
<p>“I want an answer. An honest one. I want to know why you’re willing to suffer so much for your empire at the hands of mine. Is it your family, your children? Have they threatened harm to your loved ones if you break? Or do you expect some reward in your heathen afterlife? Help me understand why you keep feeding us false intelligence, no matter what you know it means for you.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrow. Her gaze is eerily intense for how frail, broken, and helpless she looks even as her unblinking eyes meet mine. My mistress trained me in all sorts of tricks for emotional manipulation back when I was but a common apprentice; how to twist and control your body language to keep it from betraying your true inner state, and how to wield your control over the perceptions of those around you to lead them on the path to ruin. I don’t bother with any of it. For once in my life, I really do have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>“I do not know what understanding of loyalty a barbarian like you could possibly have,” she says at last, “but I make my sacrifice for the People. I make my sacrifice to protect all the friends and loved ones I will never see again. I make my sacrifice so your murderous hands will never again defile our worlds by their touch. I make my sacrifice for all those who would make the same sacrifice for me. All those who have made such sacrifices before, to give me those twenty-four precious cycles in a place where hardship holds no purchase and cruelty no power. A place where gentleness, kindness, and love are valued and cherished above all. We are no empire, barbarian. We do not take, we do not steal, we do not enslave; no steroid-addled thugs are permitted to rape and murder our own, nor do we devour our greenworlds like the storm of locusts that is Imperial greed, making corpses of plants and slaves of children. We are everything you are not.” She takes a shaky breath, tears glinting in the corner of her eye. “The day may come in your lifetime, though it will not come in mine, when the People again set our liberating fleets against yours and strip your abominable taint from the worlds you have for too long polluted. I pray you live long enough to die at my comrades’ hands.”</p>
<p>I exhale deeply. “So it’s really true, then? Everything people say about your Society? All those fanciful myths like— like nobody ever starving, never going homeless? No nobles and struggles for power?”</p>
<p>The girl scoffs. “Of course it’s true,” she spits. “What did you think, that we were making it all up for shits and giggles?”</p>
<p>“Part of me was sure it was just an old trader’s tale. The grass is always greener on the other side of the border, you know? Heh. ‘Greener.’” I dig my keys out of my pocket, reaching up over her head and unlocking the manacles. She stumbles backwards as the mechanisms ratchet open, squeezing and rubbing her wrists, staring at me in astonishment.</p>
<p>“Why— why did you do th-that—”</p>
<p>“Because I want to defect and I’m hoping you’ll hold off on killing me with your bare hands long enough to let me prove my sincerity and get you home?”</p>
<p>The girl grabs hold of one of the posts she was manacled to, slowly sinking to the floor and resting her back against it. She massages her legs, taking deep, shuddering breaths. “Y-you want— to <em>defect?</em> To the <em>Society!?”</em></p>
<p><i>“Hante, surin,”</i> I affirm. She gives me a dirty look.</p>
<p>“You haven’t earned the right to call me that.”</p>
<p>I touch a hand to my brow. “I apologize. I pray you will forgive me for how little I understand of your ways.”</p>
<p>“Who the fuck even are you anyway?”</p>
<p>“Raven Goldenbough, Vizier for Defence of the Heavenly Throne and Suppression of Heresy.” I crouch down on my knees next to her. “At your service.”</p>
<p><em>“Vizier for—”</em> She shakes her head wildly. “You’re the person in <em>charge </em> of this godforsaken place? Of— of the whole fucking counterintelligence program?”</p>
<p>“And I’m willing to share whatever intelligence you require. I have a briefcase under my desk that’s loaded with copies of everything I thought might be useful to your government, though you're welcome to ransack my terminal and run off any documents you like.” I extend a hand. “What’s your name? —Well. I can keep to calling you Serenity if you like—”</p>
<p>She waves me away with one hand, cautiously shaking mine with the other; the strength of her grip is startling. “I suppose there’s no harm in telling you my <i>tashsul</i> at least. I’m… I’m Leshuen. And… I think I’d rather hear my real name again even if it is coming from a fucking <i>vittash.”</i> She glances at me again. “Or whatever you are.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s good to meet you, Leshuen.” I see the corner of her lips turn upward at the sound of her name, and she exhales softly. “Here.” I pull my work-satchel off my shoulder and set it on the floor, unbuckling it. “I brought you clothes— I’m sorry if they’re a little too big, nobody really makes anything in your size…”</p>
<p><i>“Shalar a uolar!”</i> Leshuen grabs the satchel, pulling out the tightly folded bundle of tunic and trousers, clutching it to her chest with her shaking hands and staring up at me. “Oh my God. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Would you like help getting dressed?”</p>
<p>She shakes her head. “No. Fuck no. I… think I’ll need it though. Can you help me with the trousers first?”</p>
<p>I nod, unfurling the garment and slipping it over her feet, feeling her muscles go suddenly tense at my touch. I tug the trousers up over her knees and she quickly grabs the waistband, pulling them the rest of the way up and fumbling to knot the belt-cloth. The second her cunt is covered she seems to relax a little, a look of relief flitting across her face before she tugs the tunic down over her bruised and lacerated shoulders. I can't even look at the fresh cuts along her clavicle without feeling a primal urge wrap a blanket protectively around my upper body — the skin around my collarbone feels suddenly far too tender and vulnerable. Pulling my cloak a bit closer in around me, I sit next to Leshuen, watching as she stretches the tunic down as far as it will go, hugging the cloth tight to her body.</p>
<p>“I know you must be in… in terrible pain, but—”</p>
<p>“I know, I know.” She holds out her hands. “Help me to my feet?”</p>
<p>“Gladly.” I take her hands in mine. She’s so light I have to stop myself from pulling too hard. She sways, wincing, as she stands, and clutches the post for support again.</p>
<p>“Fuck. I’m— <em>fuck!</em> I’m not sure if I can walk—”</p>
<p>“Let me support you.” I hold out my arm, and she cringes away for a moment before reluctantly drawing nearer. I put my arm around her back, under her shoulders, helping her make her way slowly towards the cell exit. I can feel how bony her back has become.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose— my sidearm—”</p>
<p>“It’s in the evidence locker; all the <i>tian bèi</i> finally gave up on making it fire. I have a key.”</p>
<p><e>“…thank</e> you.”</p>
<p>I look around sharply as we step out of the cell. The hallway is clear. “I’m going to take you to my office while I gather some things. Your gun included. You’ll be safe there for the moment.”</p>
<p>She nods. “I assume you have a plan after that?”</p>
<p>I swipe my passcard and the elevator doors slide open. “Yes. One I’ve been working on ever since I found out there was a Green being held here.”
<p>The elevator is as old and creaky as it is ornate. A mural wraps around the conical inner hull, and the control panel is a delicate bronzework, destinations spelled out in florid calligraphic script. I flick one of the switches, swiping my card again. The doors shut and the elevator begins to rise. </p>
<p>The administrative level is a far cry from the dingy, dark, oppressive atmosphere of the cells.</p>
<p>I unlock my office door, and Leshuen gasps in relief at the sight of the small sofa across from my desk. I help her to it and she collapses, snuggling up against the cushions and pulling her legs in protective. She’s crying now, tears trickling down her face.</p>
<p>“I n-never thought I’d get to lie down again—”</p>
<p>I tug open a drawer in my desk. “I have a blanket and some bai due. You must be hungry.”</p>
<p>“Yes, p-please.” Her air of suspicious seems to have melted away and she looks up at me with an expression of pathetic gratitude as I hand her the tin of pastries.</p>
<p>I move to drape the blanket over her and then a memory comes back unbidden.</p>
<p>A memory of a little girl huddled on a couch, feverish, her tunic stained all over with sweat, yet still so cold even in the warm light of the eternal Noon District. Of covering her with blankets, trying in vain to give her some kind of comfort, reduced to tears by my own helplessness.</p>
<p>One of my last memories of her.</p>
<p>I grit my teeth, push the images aside, and lay the blanket out over Leshuen. She pulls it tight around her, her shivering slowly seeming to ebb. On instinct I bend down next to her, holding out my hand.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get you home, Leshuen,” I whisper. “I promise.”</p>
<p>She looks up at me for a moment, and for the first time, her eyes are gentle, her face betraying gratitude and hope, not suspicion. Slowly, hesitantly, she reaches out to take my hand.</p>
<p><i>“Elena assulafte Leshi,”</i> she murmurs, her eyelids drooping with exhaustion. <em>Call me Leshi.</em></p>
<p>I swallow hard, nod, squeezing her palm. “I’ll be right back… Leshi.”</p>
<p>Then I get to my feet, lock my office door behind me, and set off down the dark corridor.</p>
