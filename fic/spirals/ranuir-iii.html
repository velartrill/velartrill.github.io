<h2>Verbs</h2>

<p>The good thing about Ranuir's verbs is that they're all completely regular. Every single verb obeys the exact same rules, and the rules are mostly pretty simple. However, unlike English, Ranuir has a large number of morphemes that can be attached to verbs to modify their meaning, and these morphemes can stack on each other. This lesson will give you an overview of these forms and how they're used.</p>

<section>
	<h3>Stative form</h3>
	<p>The <strong>stative form</strong> is one of the forms you've already encountered. This is simply a noun with the basic verb ending <i>-e</i> attached to it. The stative form refers to a simple ongoing state, such as the state of being in a place, of loving another person, of knowing a language, of being a citizen, or of hoping for something. Some examples:</p>
	<div class="deflist">
		<div><b>pare</b> <i>(v)</i> talk, speak, say</div>
		<div><b>nume</b> <i>(v)</i> have to do with</div>
		<div><b>mire</b> <i>(v)</i> love romantically</div>
		<div><b>tahe</b> <i>(v)</i> be cruel</div>
		<div><b>dale</b> <i>(v)</i> exist</div>
		<div><b>nare</b> <i>(v)</i> cause, be a reason</div>
		<div><b>pele</b> <i>(v)</i> be happy</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Causative form</h3>
	<p>The <strong>causative form</strong> of a stative verb communicates the action of placing someone or something into a state. For example, the causative form of <i>mire</i> “to love romantically” would mean something like “to seduce.” Like many Ranuir verb forms, the causative has two sub-forms, one that is much stronger than the other. The <strong>weak causative</strong> implies that the agent plays a less immediate or forceful role in state-change, whereas the <strong>strong causative</strong> is strongly “agentive,” often implying that someone was forced into a state, possibly even physically.</p>
	<p>The weak causative is formed by doubling the first consonant of the verb and prefixing it with <i>a-</i>, unless it begins with a /d/ or a /t/, in which case no doubling occurs and the prefixes <i>av-</i> and <i>af-</i> are used. For instance, the weak causative of <i>mire</i> is <i>ammire.</i> The strong caustive is formed by inserting an <i>-s-</i> after the first consonant, and prefixing the first consonant with <i>a-</i>. So the strong causative of <i>amsire</i>.</p>

<section>
	<h3>Cessative form</h3>
	<p>The <strong>cessative form</strong> of a stative verb indicates the termination of a state. It is formed by taking the first consonant and copying it before the last <i>-e</i>, then prefixing an <i>e-</i> to the verb. For example, the cessative of <i>case</i> “to hope” is <i>ecasce</i> “to lose hope.”</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Causative-cessative form</h3>
	<p>The <strong>causative-cessative form</strong> combines the meanings of the causative and cessative, signalling the action of causing another to leave a state, or causing a state to cease applying. The weak form is formed by prefixing a verb with <i>ev-</i>, so the weak causative-cessative form of <i>iure</i> “to live” would be <i>eviure</i> “to cause to die.” The strong form is formed by doubling up the final vowel before the terminal <i>-e</i> and inserting <i>-nd-</i> between them, e.g. <i>iundure</i> “to kill.”</p>
