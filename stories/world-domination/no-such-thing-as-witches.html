<h1>No such thing as witches</h1>
<div class="byline">by Lexi Summer Hale</div>

<p>The Queen's Ass, now there was a name. Mahatari Sachi, Anahari expatriate, was surprised the Onamashi queen allowed such a thing. The tavern was bustling as she entered, and she sauntered up to the counter.</p>

<p>“What’ll it be, m’lass?” asked the bartender, giving her a friendly grin.</p>

<p>“A pint of cider.” Sachi flicked a coin across the counter and flashed a smile.</p>

<p>“Fine choice, ma’am,” said the barman. He handed her a mug.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Sachi extended a hand. “Name’s Sachi.”</p>

<p>“I heard of you,” said the barman, nodding. “Folks from that village of yours, they says you’s a witch,” he added conspiritorially.</p>

<p>Sachi laughed. “Do you believe them?”</p>

<p>“Tch! No such thing as witches, m’lass,” said the barman knowingly. “Just an old story to scare children with, I tells ya.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely right,” said Sachi, grinning. “I can see you’re a smart man...” She cocked her head.</p>

<p>“Orimáse,” said the bartender, “but people round here just call me Ori.”</p>

<p>“Well then, you’re a smart man, Ori-kama. This cider is excellent, by the w-”</p>

<p><em>“Mahatari Sachi!”</em> The door to the bar slammed open, and a man dressed in black robes stormed into the room, followed by three Merayan paladins. The clientele went silent, scrambling to get a view of the fight they knew was coming.</p>

<p>Sachi rolled her eyes. “Is it that time already?” she mouthed at the barman, and turned around. “I’m right here, boys” she announced coolly, folding her arms. “You don’t need to shout.”</p>

<p>The man pointed an accusing finger at her. “You are charged with apostasy and witchcraft, and by the authority of the Merayan Inquisition and the Prophet Kelaune, I order you to submit!”</p>

<p>“Buy me dinner first,” said Sachi, leaning casually against the bar.</p>

<p>“You may throw yourself upon the mercy of Meraya, or you may die where you stand!” the inquisitor bellowed.</p>

<p>“And what if I did?” Sachi asked, sipping her cider. “What would you do then, eh?”</p>

<p>“You will be brought to Holy City and face an ecclesiastic tribunal for your crimes, witch,” sneered the inquisitor. “It is your only hope for purification!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound very fun,” said Sachi. “I’m gonna have to say thanks but no thanks, all right? Run along now.”</p>

<p>The crowd roared with laughter. The inquisitor’s face went scarlet.</p>

<p>“Seize her!” he roared, and the paladins rushed forward.</p>

<p>Sachi flicked a finger. Green sparks lit up in the air, and darted at the paladins, who stumbled. Two fell to their knees retching. The other stared at her for a moment before falling over backwards, unconscious. The crowd was shouting its drunken approval as the little sprites leapt up and down on the paladin's heads, burbling with laughter.</p>

<p>The inquisitor stared in shock for a moment, and then drew his sword. “On your feet, louts!” he shouted, striding forward. “I command you, seize her!”</p>

<p><em>“Ahi huechi, ahi ahi shasha,”</em> Sachi murmured. A little fire sprite crawled up over her shoulder, and giggling, darted towards the inquisitor, its fiery wings leaving a trail in the air.</p>

<p>The inquisitor’s sword passed straight through the sprite, and he bellowed in surprise as his cloak caught fire. The sprite shrieked with delight, darting back and forth as if to taunt him.</p>

<p>“Witch! Whore of Anur!” he bellowed as he struggled out of the flaming garment. Sachi whistled, and his hair erupted in flame.</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that someone in the crowd decided to toss their drink on the inquisitor, and he erupted in an alcohol-fueled conflagration. Howling in pain and fury, he fled the tavern, his hair and most of his clothing blazing merrily, followed blearily by the two paladins dragging their unconscious companion.</p>

<p>The crowd in the tavern broke into applause.</p>

<p>Sachi grinned, and turned back to the bartender. “Like I was saying,” she said, winking. “No such thing as witches at all.”</p>

<p>Beside her, the little intoxication sprites fell eagerly upon the cider.</p>

<p>The bartender regarded her steadily for a moment, and then pushed her coins back across the counter.</p>

<p>“On the house,” he said nervously.</p>
