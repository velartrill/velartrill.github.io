<p>“And now the the universe is giggling.”</p>
<p>Tymase sighed heavily, and shoved the control console away. “I give up!” she shouted. “I fucking give up!”</p>
<p>Vetsig glanced over from the main monitor bank. “This is probably the single worst simulation package I’ve ever worked with. If their testimonials aren’t bullshit I’m amazed Vanismorium hasn’t already blown up the galactic economy.”</p>
<p>“If this is a fucking sim package may Heaven deny me,” growled Tymase. “This is terrorism, Vetsig. Informatic terrorism. Why, I’ll bet it’s straight-up sabotage. Infodyne Informatics?” She stabbed an accusing finger in what she presumed was the direction of the Infodyne Officeworld. “Fucking front for Society spies, I’ll bet you anything. Here to sabotage our industry!”</p>
<p>“Calm down,” said Vetsig. “I’ll go see if I can’t wrangle Omal into ordering a better package.” He sighed. “Again.”</p>
<p>“Or a goddamn loose AI,” muttered Tymase as he left the room. “Mark my words, we’re probably both meme-tainted already!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Six hundred parsecs spinwards, Subdirector of Countervalue Operations Saquel Elerese Lumesarc of the Society steepled her hands. “The numbers are in?”</p>
<p>The liaison nodded. “Infodyne Hypersim alone seems to have cut gross output by an average seventeen percent across half a dozen industries. The more subtle packages are disrupting organizational capacities nicely. The entire Pehek subsector should be ripe for the picking in just six years time if all things go as planned.”</p>
<p>Subdirector Saquel smiled. “Excellent work. Convey my congratulations to the task force, Elesea. Dismissed.”</p>
<p>The liaison saluted sharply, and left the room.</p>
