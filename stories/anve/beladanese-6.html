<h1>Speaking Beladanese, Chapter VI</h1>
<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (@<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">velartrill</a>)</i></p>

<p>This time we're going to take a break from the practical exercises and learn how to fully conjugate a Beladanese verb.
Every verb has four stems (here called Stem I, Stem II, Stem III, and Stem IV). Stem I and Stem II are the basic forms of the
verb on from which the other stems derive. For <em>most</em> verbs they're the same, but Stem II and Stem I aren't
always strictly predictable from each other — verbs where they differ are called <em>stem-changing</em> verbs.</p>

<p>Here are some examples.</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>Class</th><th>Lemma</th><th>I</th><th>II</th><th>III</th><th>IV</th></tr>
	<tr><th>A</th><td>parna</td><td>parn-</td><td>parn-</td><td>parn-</td><td>parn-</td></tr>
	<tr><td></td><td colspan="5"><em>Form remains constant.</em></td></tr>
	<tr><th>B</th><td>bosta</td><td>bost-</td><td>bost-</td><td>boss-</td><td>bos-</td></tr>
	<tr><td></td><td colspan="5"><em>‹st› assimilates to ‹ss› in III, which reduces to ‹s› in IV.</em></td></tr>
	<tr><th>C</th><td>puenche</td><td>panch-</td><td>puench-</td><td>panch-</td><td>panch-</td></tr>
	<tr><td></td><td colspan="5"><em>Vowel weakens unpredictably in II.</em></td></tr>
	<tr><th>D</th><td>hueste</td><td>hast-</td><td>huest-</td><td>hass-</td><td>has-</td></tr>
	<tr><td></td><td colspan="5"><em>Class B with a weakening vowel.</em></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This seems really complicated at first and a lot to memorize, but really you only need to memorize Stem I and Stem II, which
are usually the same. These changes happen to aid pronunciation in certain verb forms, so getting into the habit of making them
automatically shouldn't be difficult.</p>

<p>Next, let's look at a conjugation chart, so we can tell how these stems are actually useful. Note that in the chart below,
the symbol V represents the vowel at the end of the base form.</p>

<p>Okay, that was one hell of an infodump. Don't worry, you don't need to memorize all of this right
away; it's just provided as a reference - and to give people who already know the jargon a head start. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's practice with some important verbs and
talk a little about relationships in Beladan culture.</p>

<p>In general, Beladanese doesn't have nouns for relationships. Social roles like "mother,"
"father," "child," and "slave" have nouns associated with them, but there are no nouns meaning
"friend" or "enemy." (Technically this isn't <em>quite</em> true; you can derive nouns
carrying these meanings, but you'd get very odd looks for using them.) Instead, Beladanese
uses verbs. To analogize with English, it's like saying "I friend her" instead of "She's my friend."</p>

<p>The first of these verbs is <em>lige</em>, a Class A verb which describes a relationship of choice, without professional, political, or familial boundaries - the sort of person you'd use the
pronoun <em>is</em> around if you're a woman. Let's take a poke at translating some
examples - don't worry if you can't guess them all, but note how each form of the verb is being
used.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Asmari lige te tama Chirachande.
		<div class="answer">I'm friends with Chirachande's uncle.</div></li>
	<li>Ascarna ligitte te ar ras.
		<div class="answer">I used to be friends with your mother.</div></li>
	<li>Enna ras ligencue!
		<div class="answer">I'm not your friend!</div></li>
	<li>Asmari ras ligirinne.
		<div class="answer">We weren't friends (and we still aren't).</div></li>
	<li>Is ras ligiritte.
		<div class="answer">We weren't friends (but we are now).</div></li>
</ol>

<p>Note the difference in (4) and (5). In (4), the negative past imperfective is used, which
codes a state in the past <em>that continues into the present.</em> In (5), the past
negative past <em>perfective</em> is used, which codes a state that has finished or is no
longer true. The difference in pronouns is also critical. In (4), the speaker uses the respectful
first-person singular <em>asmari</em>, which you likely wouldn't use with someone
you had <em>ligestue</em> with.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the adverbial form now. The <em>-i</em> ending in Beladanese
works a lot like <me>-ly</em> in English, except it can be applied to any verb, not just
descriptive ones.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ligi chanda fasta.
		<div class="answer">She speaks in a friendly way, casually.</div></li>
	<li>Parni rasuendi fastam.
		<div class="answer">Y'all speak fuckily, hornily.</div></li>
	<li>Meclistachi cuala fasta.
		<div class="answer">I speak beautifully.</div></li>
	<li>Cardastachi corde te gabra.
		<div class="answer">The goat is fashionably dead.</div></li>
	<li>Parna te ar is te tigal archi.
		<div class="answer">Maternally, my mother fucks my father.</div></li>
</ol>

<p>Adverbs can be placed at the beginning or end of a clause. If you place the adverb at the
end, its meaning affects the whole sentence - "It is fashionable the goat is dead," "It is
beautiful that you speak." Otherwise, the adverb describes the performance of the verb.
"The goat is dead in a fashionable way," "It is beautiful how I speak.</p>

<p>There's another verb we use for "family friends," people who aren't relatives but who
you know because your family has some sort of political or business relationship with. This
verb is <em>gefta</em>. Note that this is never interchangeable with <em>lige</em>.
In English, "friend" is a basic meaning that we qualify with other words, but
<em>geftastue</em> is not a subset of <em>ligestue.</em> They are two very with
distinct concepts.</p>

<p>Finally, we have<em>suenca</em>, a Class C verb. You use this verb to talk about
neighbors you're on good terms with.</p>

<p>So how do you say "A friend of mine" in Beladanese? Generally, you don't. In English,
we might say things like "A friend of mine got kidnapped by Shan slavers," but in Beladanese,
you would generally split this up into two sentences, one to introduce the friend, the second to
say what happened to them. "Chirachande is a friend of mine. She got kidnapped by Shan slavers."</p>
<p>However, if you really need to, you can use a <em>relative clause</em>. Come back
next time to learn how those work!</p>
