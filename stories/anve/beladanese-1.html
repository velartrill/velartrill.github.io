<h1>Speaking Beladanese, Chapter I</h1>
<img src="img/belad.png" style="float: right;">
<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (@<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">velartrill</a>)</i></p>


<p>Beladanese <em>(te nistal Belad,</em> <nobr>«<img src="img/text-beladanese.svg" style="height: 1.2em; margin-bottom: -0.4em">»</nobr>) is the language spoken by the people of Belad. Internationally, it's the
language of science and engineering, and knowing Beladanese is a sign of education and 
refinement in many countries.</p>
<p>We're going to start out with some simple words and phrases. You'll learn right away
to say some simple and useful things in Beladanese, and how to pronounce it correctly.
Beladanese pronunciation may seem difficult or complicated at first, but after a while
it'll start to feel much more fluid than English.</p>
<p>The first word we're going to learn is <i><b>te cambe</b> "tree"</i>. It's pronounced [te ˈkambe] -
in fact, if you pronounce it like it's a Spanish word, you won't be too far off. Of note
to native English speakers is that we're tempted to pronounce it like [tʰe ˈkʰambe] - that
is, with a little puff of air after the [t] and [k]. You want a [t] sound like the t in 
"stop", not like in "tea". </p>
<p>Got all that? Great, now to a Beladanese speaker, you can point at a tree and go <b><i>"te
cambe!"</i></b> and they'll know exactly what you mean. Let's take it a bit further and learn
a verb so we can say something about the tree. Let's go with <i><b>puenche</b> "be on
fire."</i> This word is pronounced [ˈpwent͡ʃe] - in other words, the "ch" is pronounced just
like the ch in Spanish or in some English words like "cheese". </i>
<p>So, how do we say "the tree is on fire" in Beladanese? We're tempted to say "Te cambe
puenche," but this is wrong! In Beladanese, we always put the verb at the <em>start</em> of a
clause, not the middle like in English or Spanish. So to say "The tree is on fire," we
say <b><i>"Puenche te cambe."</i></b></p>
<p>Great! Now we know how to form a simple sentence. Let's introduce some new vocabulary, and
you can practice making sentences.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>te tira</b> [te ˈtiɾa] "uncle"</li>
	<li><b>te tinga</b> [te ˈtiŋga] "mouth"</li>
	<li><b>te ar</b> [te ˈʔaɾ] "mother"</li>
</ol>
<p>Uh oh, we've got some new symbols in the transcription here! The first is [ɾ], which we
pronounce like the ‹r› in Spanish "pero" or the ‹tt›/‹dd› in American English "batter"/"badder". Most
of the time when you see an ‹r› in Beladanese, this is the sound it makes - but there are
some important exceptions we'll get to later! Next is [ŋ] which is easy - it's just like the
‹ng›'s in English "saying" or "singing". Last, we have [ʔ] which is a bit trickier - it's the
sound between the "uh" and the "oh" in the English word "Uh oh." You can also hear it if you
say "What's the matter?" in a thick Cockney accent - the ‹tt› in "matter" gets reduced down
to a glottal stop. But why are we inserting this here? There's no letter for it!</p>
<p>[ʔ] is actually not what we would call "phonemic" in Beladanese - that is, it's not part
of the word on its own. You only insert it in special cases, like this one: whenever we have
two vowels next to each other in Beladanese that aren't part of the same word, we always
include a  "glottal stop" so that listeners can tell where one word stops and another starts.
This means that if we had a consonant in front of the ‹a›, we wouldn't be inserting this at all!</p>
<p>All right, now let's translate some sentences to Beladanese. Go ahead and say your guess
out loud, and then run the mouse over the empty box to see if you were right.</p>
<ol>
	<li>"Mother is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te ar.</div></li>
	<li>"Uncle is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te tira.</div></li>
	<li>"A tree is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te cambe.</div></li>
	<li>"The mouth is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te tinga.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you got those all right! Now as you've probably noticed, there's in little word
"te" in front of all the nouns we've introduced so far. This word doesn't really have an
English equivalent, but it's very important to making sense of Beladanese. "Te" is what we
call a "determiner," and you need one in every noun phrase. For instance, you can't say *"Puenche
ar," or *"Puenche tira" - anyone who speaks Beladanese would think you're a bit simple for
saying it that way and would probably give you a condescending pat on the head.</p>
<p>Why is "te" so important? Well, let's look at another verb. So far we've only used an
<em>intransitive</em> verb, "puenche" - that is, it only applies to one argument. Now we're going
to learn our first <em>transitive</em> verb, which is where the importance of "te" becomes
very visible. This verb is <i><b>ramma</b> "to be inside"</i> [ɾamma].</p>
<p>Of course, this verb has some funny new things going on with the pronunciation. We already
know all these sounds, but ‹m› is doubled? What does this mean? Well, it means exactly what it
looks like - that we linger on the [m] sound a little bit longer than usual. In linguistics, we call
this "gemination." It's like if you were saying "ram ma" in English: there are two syllables, [ɾam]
+ [ma] and we don't skip over the second [m] ever the way we usually do in English. This is very
important when you're pronouncing Beladanese, because you might accidentally say a different
word than you intended. Always be mindful of your gemination!</p>
<p>Now, we can say things like "There's a tree inside my mouth:" <b><i>Ramma te cambe te tinga is.</i></b>
"Te tinga is" is how you say "My mouth" in Beladanese - "is" (pronounced [is] like in "p<b>iece</b>")
is the word you use when you're talking about yourself, like "I" or "me" or "mine" in English. And now
we can start to see why the "te" is so important - it lets us tell where one argument stops and the next
one begins. If we just said "Ramma cambe tinga is," it might mean "There's a tree in my mouth" or "The
tree's mouth is inside me," and we'd have no way to tell besides context. And since these are both very
unlikely sentences in any language, we probably wouldn't have a whole lot of context to go on.</p>
<p>Now let's go out on a limb a bit and see if you can guess how to say a few phrases. If this doesn't
make sense to you yet, don't worry, we'll explain this next!</p>
<ol>
	<li>"my mother" <div class="answer">te ar is</div></li>
	<li>"my uncle" <div class="answer">te tira is</div></li>
	<li>"my tree" <div class="answer">te cambe is</div></li>
	<li>"uncle's tree" <div class="answer">te cambe tira</div></li>
	<li>"mother's tree" <div class="answer">te cambe ar</div></li>
	<li>"mother's uncle" <div class="answer">te tira ar</div></li>
	<li>"my mother's uncle" <div class="answer">te tira ar is</div></li>
	<li style="opacity:0;"></li> <!-- keep the column layout from getting screwy -->
</ol>
<p>If you got these right, congrats! You're already ahead of the game. What this is called is the "genitive
phrase," and it lets us say who a thing belongs to or is part of. It's very simple: all you do is take a noun
and add another noun to it. If "te cambe" belongs to "te tira," you just say "te cambe tira." Keep in mind that
the possessor always comes second, unlike in English - we say "my mother's uncle" but the Beladans say "the uncle
mother me".</p>
<p>There's one last detail you should learn about "ramma," however: if you use it to talk about two people,
<em>it means something very different.</em></p>
<ol>
	<li>Ramma te ar te tira. <div class="answer">Mother is fucking uncle.</div></li>
	<li>Is ramma te tira is. <div class="answer">I'm fucking my uncle.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>So be careful when you're talking if you don't want people to think you're using the slang sense! There's a less-slangy
word for "to fuck" that lets you say things like "Mother is fucking the doorknob" or "Uncle is fucking the bank,"
but we'll get to that next chapter, because there's more tricky pronunciation involved.</p>
<p>But now wait a minute - we said earlier that the verb comes first, but here we have the word "is" going before the verb! What's going on here? Well, there's a special exception to that rule: whenever the subject (the first argument) of a verb in Beladanese is a <em>pronoun</em> (a word like I, you, she, it, or they), it always precedes the verb.</p>
<p>All right, one last exercise for this chapter: let's put together everything we've learned so far into more
complex sentences.</p>
<ol>
	<li>"Mother's tree is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te cambe ar is.</div></li>
	<li>"Uncle is in my tree." <div class="answer">Ramma te tira te cambe is.</div></li>
	<li>"My mother's uncle's tree is on fire." <div class="answer">Puenche te cambe tira ar is.</div></li>
	<li style="opacity:0;"></li> <!-- keep the column layout from getting screwy -->
</ol>
<p>And try to translate these Beladanese sentences back to English:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ramma te cambe te tinga is.<div class="answer">There's a tree in my mouth.</div></li>
	<li>Is ramma te cambe. <div class="answer">I'm in a tree.</div></li>
	<li>Ramma te tira is te cambe is.<div class="answer">My uncle is in my tree.</div></li>
	<li style="opacity:0;"></li> <!-- keep the column layout from getting screwy -->
</ol>
<p>And that's it for this chapter! Tune in next time to learn about retroflex consonants and talking
about two things very important to the Beladan people: fashion and dead goats.</p>
