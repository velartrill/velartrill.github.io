<p><span class="quote hayochi">“Here’s the guest wing,”</span> said Hayochi, sliding back a door that Len hadn’t even noticed at first. <span class="quote hayochi">“You can have your pick of room; this part of the house doesn’t see much use these days. I’m afraid they’re not very tidy at the moment,”</span> she added anxiously, <span class="quote hayochi">“but I can-”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“That’s all right,”</span> Len assured her, patting her on the shoulder. <span class="quote lenwin">“I can deal with some light housework.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“Of course, <i>sukunue.</i> Er, will you be accompanying us to temple tonight?”</span> Hayochi added, as Len unslung her bag from her weary shoulders.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“You’re going with the family, then?”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“I wouldn’t dream of leaving Tara alone, especially not after... what just happened.”</span> Hayochi shook her head violently.
</p><p>Len studied her face for a moment. Elves were not the easiest people to read. They might look like little humans with pointy ears and slate-gray skin, but looks could be very, very deceiving.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“You really love your mistress, don’t you?”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to intrude, but—”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“I do.”</span> Hayochi’s voice was shaking slightly. Her eyes were suddenly wild. <span class="quote hayochi">“You know what I first thought when I saw you, goldeneyes? I wanted to slam the door and run. Hide like a rabbit running from a wolf.”</span>
</p><p>Len was taken aback at the abrupt shift in her demeanor. She stepped back slightly to give the elf more space. <span class="quote lenwin">“That wasn’t an unreasonable reaction, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“Do you know why I’m here? A forest elf in Lemua? I sold myself, Shan. I sold myself because it was safer than <em>waiting to be taken.”</em></span> Hayochi’s knuckles were white, her fingers pressed tightly against her palm. It looked almost like she was balling her fists, but aggression, Len knew, was alien to the species. From what little she had picked up of elfin body language from the slaves of the old country, she guessed it might be a sign of some sort of intense emotion.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“By my people, you mean?”</span> said Len.
</p><p>Hayochi nodded.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“I know you have every reason to hate and fear us,”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“But—”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“But you saved her,”</span> said Hayochi. <span class="quote hayochi">“You saved Tara. When I would have gotten her killed. I don’t think you can know how much that means to me.”</span> Her fists unclenched, and she looked down quickly. <span class="quote hayochi">“I’m sorry,”</span> she babbled, the sudden maniac intensity vanishing as quickly as it had come. <span class="quote hayochi">“I’m sorry, mistress, I didn’t mean to be rude—”</span>
</p><p>Len took the elf by the shoulder. <span class="quote lenwin">“I promise you have nothing to fear from me, Hayochi,”</span> she said quietly. <span class="quote lenwin">“And for whatever it’s worth, not all of us want to see your people enslaved.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“You’ll protect Tara?”</span> said Hayochi, her wide rose eyes staring up into Len’s.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“That’s my job now,”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“And I am very good at my job, little elf.”</span>
</p><p>Hayochi hugged her. <span class="quote hayochi"><em>“Sohane yallanen.</em> Thank you. If you hadn’t been here... I don’t even want to think about it.”</span>
</p><p>Len’s eyes narrowed. <span class="quote lenwin">“About that,”</span> she said, patting the elf on the back. <span class="quote lenwin">“Could you send Tara to me before you leave? I need to have some words with her.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote hayochi">“Of course, mistress!”</span> Hayochi nodded, releasing her. <span class="quote hayochi">“You’re not coming along, then?”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“That depends,”</span> said Len.
</p><p>The elf scampered off and Len poked her head into one of the rooms. Gentle moonlight wafted down through a window in the roof, scattering about the room from the reflective floor. It was enough to see by, but she thumbed a small fireglass lamp by the bedside to life for Tara’s benefit. She propped her staff against the wall and had set about unloading her luggage when she felt Tara’s approach and turned.
</p><p>The younger woman curtseyed politely. <span class="quote taracuele">“You asked for me, Len-<i>alani?”</i></span>
</p><p>Len nodded. <span class="quote lenwin">“Yes, Tara-”</span> She struggled for a moment, trying to find the right honorific, before settling on <span class="quote lenwin"><i>“-chen</i>. I wanted to ask you some questions about your health. In private.”</span>
</p><p>Tara nodded. <span class="quote taracuele">“I expected you would have questions. Your training is medical, yes?”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“In part,”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“Given your chronic illness, I expect tending to your health will be a significant part of my duties.”</span>
</p><p>A frown flickered across Tara’s face. <span class="quote taracuele">“I assure you, <i>kinue,</i> my symptoms are under control. They have been for some time.”</span>
</p><p>Len nodded. <span class="quote lenwin">“How many days have you been off your medication, Taracuele?”</span>
</p><p>The young woman’s body language changed instantly. Her eyes widened fractionally and her back stiffened. <span class="quote taracuele">“I - what are you -”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“Do you really expect me to believe that I showed up on the exact day someone tried to poison you?”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“Your grandmother will figure it out too, as soon as she sits down and clears her head a bit.”</span>
</p><p>Tara stared at Len for a moment, her lips pursed. Finally, her shoulders sagged, and she looked down.
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Not since last season.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“Last - Tara, what disease do you have, exactly?”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Respectfully, <i>kinue</i>, that’s none of your-”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“Taracuele fal Chistar, I have been retained by your matriarch to serve your family, and that task includes keeping you safe <em>from whoever is trying to murder you,”</em></span> snapped Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“But I can’t do my job unless I know what you’re facing.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele"><i>“Somari</i> syndrome!”</span> Tara blurted. <span class="quote taracuele">“All right? I have <i>Somari</i> syndrome. But I’m fine; I eat well, I sleep well, I can live without relying on some awful medication-”</span>
</p><p><i><span class="quote lenwin">“Somari—?”</span></i> Len stared. <span class="quote lenwin">“You mean… <i>Tiang Sho?</i> No. No, Tara, you can’t. In fact you should be dead already. Without those medicinals, your body should have torn itself apart.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Maybe I’m strong enough!”</span> Tara shot back. <span class="quote taracuele">“Maybe it’s the emacy, or - or the drugs I use for it. I don’t know! But I don’t need what my grandmother thinks I need.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“No. Tara, you got incredibly lucky.”</span> Len fixed her gaze on the younger woman, inflecting her voice with tones of command. <span class="quote lenwin">“I need you to promise me that you’ll start taking your medicine again as soon as your mother finds a new supplier.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Do you know how much it costs us?”</span> Tara cried. <span class="quote taracuele">“If it wasn’t for my medicine, they’d be able to afford to fix up the farms-”</span>
</p><p>Len shook her head. <span class="quote lenwin">“That’s what this is about? You’re feeling <em>guilty that your family is keeping you alive?”</em></span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“I was going to go a season without the medicine, prove I didn’t need it—”</span>
</p><p><em><span class="quote lenwin">“You do need it.”</span></em> Len made the words as forceful as she could without raising her voice. <span class="quote lenwin">“<i>Tiang Sho</i> is not something you play games with. All that’s kept you alive has been the will of Meraya, and miracles are no replacement for medicine. I’ll work with your mother, try to negotiate a better price on the silver laurel — that is the most expensive part of your medicine, yes?”</span>
</p><p>Tara nodded.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“And in the meantime, I’ll pray to gods and the Prophet that you <em>wake up tomorrow morning.”</em></span> Len shook her head. <span class="quote lenwin">“You don’t seem to be in the terminal phase so even if whatever is keeping you alive runs out, you should have a few days before there’s any permanent damage.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Yes, <i>kinue</i>.”</span> Tara inclined her head submissively.
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“Thank you for being reasonable, milady.”</span> Len sighed. <span class="quote lenwin">“You should go talk to your elf. She nearly broke down after the attempt on your life.”</span>
</p><p>Tara nodded. <span class="quote taracuele">“I don’t know what I would do without Hayochi. She’s... kept me alive, in a way.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“I would not have expected so much affection from a slave for her mistress,”</span> said Len. <span class="quote lenwin">“But then Belad is a very different place from my homeland.”</span> She frowned. <span class="quote lenwin">“On the subject of which — it is my understanding of Beladan law that a bedslave may not be used for domestic labor. And yet Hayochi seems to serve you in that capacity as well.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Hayochi is as much part of this family as Nalichenda is,”</span> said Tara. <span class="quote taracuele">“We all do what we can, and do it willingly. Nobody is compelling her.”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote lenwin">“I see.”</span> Len bowed. <span class="quote lenwin">“Thank you for speaking to me, milady. Let your grandmother know I’ll be accompanying you to the temple, could you?”</span>
</p><p><span class="quote taracuele">“Of course, Len-<i>kinue</i>.”</span> Tara curtseyed again. <span class="quote taracuele">“If you’ll excuse me.”</span></p>
