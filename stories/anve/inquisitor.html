<h1>Inquisitor</h1>

<p>The lash connected with my back again, the pain biting hard through my body. I stiffened in my restraints and bit back a cry. They’d been at it for hours now. I felt the blood dripping from my battered skin dripping down my back, into the vessel at my feet. A coarse paper slid across my back as an acolyte pressed torn pages of the Holy Book to dry the blood, mumbling its words hastily.</p>

<p>Menora give me strength.</p>

<p>“Dawn approaches,” said a voice I dimly recognized. The whip cracked again. This time I couldn’t suppress a whimper.</p>

<p>“May the coming dawn favor o...our beloved prophet.”</p>

<p>Footsteps. “On the dawn of First Day, what did the Prophet say to her disciples?” The voice was elderly, but full of power.</p>

<p>“‘I am your Prophet and your light, the sword of your faith,’” I recited. “‘I am the truth in a world shrouded in lies.’” Again the whip bit into my flesh.</p>

<p>“In light, revelation. In unity, power. In pain, truth. In darkness, light.” The mantra and the will of the Prophet had sustained me for that night of agony, and it took a moment to register that the voice that had spoken it was not my own this time. The Abbess of the Inquisition stood beside me now, gazing with me out the barred window at the top of the ritual chamber.</p>

<p>I repeated the mantra, shakily, and even as I spoke the words, the first sliver of light from the sun shone down into the chamber. From where I stood, it was as though I beheld the smile of the Prophet herself.</p>

<p>The Abbess raised her hand, and the Inquisitor with the lash lowered it. She bowed her head, and withdrew. The Abbess stepped in front of me, her grey eyes locked with mine.</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>I responded as expected. “I have none.”</p>

<p>“Of whose womb were your born?”</p>

<p>“I am born of the Prophet.”</p>

<p>“What god do you serve?”</p>

<p>“I serve no god.”</p>

<p>“Whom then do you serve?”</p>

<p>“I serve unity. I serve only Menora.”</p>

<p>“You have faced your Night of Harrowing,” said the Abbess. She lit a match, and dropped it into the pile of blood-soaked scripture. The flame burned white. “And come the Dawn, you still are strong. You have walked the path of the Prophet and now you stand at its end.” She placed a hand on my chest, and the flame rose, licking at my feet. “For this, I now name thee Lady Inquisitor Selanda, true daughter and servant of the Prophet Menora and no other, and I commend all your past unto the abyss.” </p>

<p>At her touch, I felt a warmth flood through me, a soothing, overwhelming power that bit into my soul itself. I closed my eyes and gave into its will.</p>

<p>The Abbess withdrew her hand and I fell to my knees as my restraints released me. My veins shone with white light as what could only be the touch of the Prophet herself rippled with me, shaping and changing me as suited her purpose.</p>

<p>“Rise, my lady,” said the Abbess, and to me amazement and joy I found despite the night of torture the strength to stand welling up within me. I climbed to my feet, and met the Abbess’ hard grey eyes.</p>

<p>“This is the final sacrament,” she said. “The last of our sacred mysteries open to you. You are a sister of the Inquisition. Congratulations, my dear.”</p>

<p>I bowed. “Thank you, your grace.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Abbess, lifting my head. “Today, you bow to no one, <em>your grace.</em? Only the Herald and the Prophet may command you now.”</p>
