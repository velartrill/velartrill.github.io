<h1>Speaking Beladanese, Chapter II</h1>
<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (@<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">velartrill</a>)</i></p>

<p>Time to learn some new words so you can discuss high fashion and dead goats with all your
high-society friends! The first new word is <i><b>cardastache</b> "be fashionable"</i> and it's
pronounced [kaɖasˈtat͡ʃe].</p>
<p>But oh no - there's a new symbol here! And what happened to the r, anyway? Well, as it
turns out, Beladans have a habit of running certain sounds together. For the last few centuries,
the letter ‹r› has tended to disappear when it's near a compatible consonant, and it changes that
consonant instead of being pronounced itself. The Beladan ‹rd› sound is just like ‹d› except you
curl your tongue up behind your upper teeth a little. This may sound strange, but if you say
[aɾde] fast enough a few times, you'll start to see why - it's really very easy to run those 
sounds together and produce what we call a <i>retroflex consonant</i></p>
<p>Beladanese has a few of these sounds: ‹rd› = [ɖ], ‹rt› = [ʈ], ‹rs› = [ʂ], ‹rch› = [ʈ͡ʂ], and rl = [ɭ]. But
you shouldn't have to memorize all of these - just remember that when you see an ‹r› next to another
consonant, don't pronounce the ‹r›, just roll your tongue up behind your teeth and pronounce the
next consonant.</p>
<p>Phew! Now that we've got that out of the way, let's try some exercises with last chapter's
vocabulary and the word we just learned. Try to pronounce all of these!</p>
<ol>
	<li>The tree is fashionable.<div class="answer">Cardastache te cambe.</div></li>
	<li>Cardastache te tira is.<div class="answer">My uncle is fashionable.</div></li>
	<li>My mother is fashionable.<div class="answer">Cardastache te ar is.</div></li>
	<li style="opacity:0;"></li> <!-- keep the column layout from getting screwy -->
</ol>
<p>Now you might be starting to notice something odd. Beladanese has all these verbs that mean
things we express in English as adjectives. We say something "is fashionable" or "is on fire," but the
Beladans just say "cardastache" or "puenche," just like any other verb. That's because Beladanese
doesn't have adjectives! Everything that we express as an adjective in English, the Beladans just
have a verb for.</p>
<p>You might also have noticed that "cardastache" and "puenche" have the same ending - "che".
There's actually a reason for this! "(a)che" is a special suffix that turns a noun into a verb. "cardastache"
is really "cardast-ache," and "puenche" is really "pan-che". (We only use the "ache" form when the
word would be hard to pronounce otherwise.) "cardast" means "fashion" and "pan" (why not "puen?"
we'll get to that soon!) means "fire", and we turn these into descriptive verbs by tacking on "(a)che".</p>
<p>Let's try using these rules to figure out new verbs from roots you already know.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I am maternal.<div class="answer">Is arche.</div></li>
	<li>Mother is avuncular (uncle-like).<div class="answer">Tirache te ar.</div></li>
	<li>Uncle's daughter is girly.<div class="answer">Falche te fal tira.</div></li>
	<li>The tree is arboreal.<div class="answer">Cambeche te cambe.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>The meaning isn't always totally predictable, but in general if you have a noun and need a word
that describes that noun, you can just stick "(a)che" on the end and you'll have a perfectly serviceable
verb.</p>
<p>Now, so far all the nouns we've seen have been singular. Singular nouns are all fine and good, but
when you're talking about what's fashionable or not, it helps to be able to talk about more than one
thing at a time. In Beladanese, this is what determiners are for. So far, we've only learned one determiner,
<i>te</i>, which carries the sense of "one single thing." The next determiner to learn is <i>cue,</i> which is
just the same as <i>te</i> but tells you you're talking about more than one thing. It's pronounced [kwe], like
in the English word "wal<b>kway</b>."</p>
<p>Now let's try some examples. Here's a new verb to use: <i><b>hacara</b> "to rule"</i> [haˈkaɾa].</p>
<ol>
	<li>I rule the trees.<div class="answer">Is hacara cue cambe.</div></li>
	<li>My mother rules my uncles.<div class="answer">Hacara te ar is cue tira is.</div></li>
	<li>Parna te fal cue cambe.<div class="answer">The girl's fucking the trees.</div></li>
	<li style="opacity:0;"></li> <!-- keep the column layout from getting screwy -->
</ol>
<p>You may have noticed something funny about these examples - we always used a singular noun in the
subject position. There's a reason for that. Plurals are a little bit more complicated in Beladanese than just
trading out one word - there are some rules for verbs too. For most verbs, it's pretty simple: if the subject
(which is Beladanese is always the first argument) is plural, you stick a <i>-m</i> on the end. Let's give it
a try.</p>
<ol>
	<li>My mother is fashionable.<div class="answer">Cardastache te ar is.</div></li>
	<li>My mothers are fashionable.<div class="answer">Cardastachem cue ar is.</div></li>
	<li>The tree is on fire.<div class="answer">Puenche te cambe.</div></li>
	<li>The trees are on fire.<div class="answer">Panchem cue cambe.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Uh oh! Now what's going on? There's something screwy with <i>puenche</i> - why isn't it "puenchem?"
Well, this is where things get tricky. The word <i>puenche</i> comes from isn't "puen" but <i>pan</i>, as we
pointed out earlier, and <i>pan</i> is a stem-changing word, which means that in certain circumstances, the -a-
in the middle is swapped out with something else. There's a whole class of words in Beladanese that work like
this - it's a remnant of a much more complicated declension and conjugation system in Old Beladanese. Luckily,
we don't have to deal with that - but we do have to deal with the mess it left behind.</p>
<p>So, here's the rule. <i>Pan</i> is a ue-stem word. That means when we have a verb in the singular present
tense, we swap out the -a- for a -ue-. But when we have a plural, it goes back to its old stem - the -a-. All ue-stem
words work just like this - the only problem is, you can't tell at a glance if a word is ue-stem or not.</p>
<p>There's one more rule for ue-stem nouns. The word for fire is <i>pan</i> but you might still see <i>puen</i>
used sometimes, in phrases like <i><b>hanagan puen</b> "physicist"</i>. That's because stem-changing words are
all that's left of the Old Beladanese declension system, and <i>pan</i> still changes to <i>puen</i> in special
circumstances. The main time this happens is when we make a possessive construction like we went over in the
last chapter. So when we say "I'm fucking the fire," we just say "Is parna te pan," but if "fire" is part of something
else, like in "physicist," then we say <i><b>Is parna te hanagan puen</b> "I'm fucking the phycisist."</i> In
linguistic terms, the stem variation codes the genitive case of stem-changing nouns, which is unmarked in
most nouns.</p>
<p>Okay, phew. Let's try something more fun: talking about dead goats.</p>
<p>You may recall from earlier that Beladanese doesn't have adjectives. The way we say "dead" is to use the verb
<i>corde</i>, but if it's not an adjective, how do we use it to describe a noun? We can say <i><b>Cordem cue gabra</b>
"The goats are dead,"</i> but what if we wanted to say "dead goats are fashionable?"</p>
<p>As it turns out, Beladanese has a special trick that makes this super easy! You can take any verb and stick it after a
determiner in a noun phrase to mean "the thing that does this." Let's look at some examples.</p>
<ol>
	<li>te hacara ar<div class="answer">the ruling mother, the mother who rules</div></li>
	<li>cue cordem gabra<div class="answer">the dead goats</div></li>
	<li>cue panchem cambe<div class="answer">the trees that are on fire</div></li>
	<li>te parna fal<div class="answer">the girl who fucks</div></li>

	<li>the girly uncle<div class="answer">te falche tira</div></li>
	<li>my fashionable tree<div class="answer">te cardastache cambe is</div></li>
	<li>uncle's dead trees<div class="answer">cue cordem cambe tira</div></li>
	<li>the arboreal elf<div class="answer">te cambeche hali</div></li>
</ol>

<p>See how this works? Now at long last, we can put together the sentence you've been waiting for.</p>
<p><i><b>Cardastachem cha cordem gabra.</b> "Dead goats are fashionable."</i></p>
<p>Wait, what? <i>Cha?</i> Where did this come from!? Well, as it turns out, there's one more determiner
we need to learn. You can only use <i>cue</i> when you're talking about some particular, distinct thing. In
English, we use the indefinite plural when we're talking about things <i>in general</i> - "cats are cute," "men
are pigs," "martians are the number one threat to America" - but this is actually very unusual. Most languages
use the definite singular - in Spanish, we don't say "los gatos son hermosos" unless we're talking about particular
cats - instead, we say something like "el gato es un animal hermoso." And in Beladanese, we need to use a special
determiner. That's where <i>cha</i> comes in. Note that we still use plural markers on the verbs!</p>
<p>For the next exercise, don't worry about the verbs and nouns - just decide whether you should use <i>cha</i>
or <i>cue</i> in each case.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The uncles are fashionable.<div class="answer">Cardastachem cue tira.</div></li>
	<li>Uncles are fashionable people.<div class="answer">Cardastachem cha tira.</div></li>
	<li>Elves are stealing our men, you know.<div class="answer">Tamandem cha hali cha corma cambari.</div></li>
	<li>Those elves over there, they're running off with our husbands!<div class="answer">Tamandem cue hali cue tigal cambari.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can tell, there isn't always a smooth translation between English and Beladanese - some of the things
Beladanese expresses grammatically, you can only express through context in English. That's why literal translations
don't always work - it's too easy to miss important information.</p>
<p>That's enough for this chapter. Come back for Chapter III when you're ready to learn how to talk about people
besides yourself, your uncles, and your mothers!</p>
