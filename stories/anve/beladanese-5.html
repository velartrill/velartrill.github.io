<h1>Speaking Beladanese, Chapter V</h1>
<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (@<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">velartrill</a>)</i></p>

<p>By now, you should be able to form simple sentences in Beladanese, things like "I like the goat" or "She steals the forest." But what if you want to say "I like that she steals the forest?" In this lesson, you'll learn how to write this kind of sentence.</p>
<p>To construct this kind of sentence, with more than one clause, we need to use something called a <em>complementizer</em>. In English, complementizers are words like "that," "how," or "to," in sentences like "I said that she left," "I hate how she's here," or "I told her to go." Beladanese has many more complementizers than English, but only one syntax for complementization.</p>
<p>The first complementizer to learn is <em>so</em>, the <em>indicative</em> complementizer. <em>So</em> is used to talk about things that are real, things that have happened, are happening, or are going to happen. Unlike in English, the complement goes <em>before</em> the rest of the sentence, and the complementizer is placed at the end of the complement. We're going to practice a few sentences with <em>so</em>, but first, we need some new vocabulary: <em>golne</em> "to see", <em>tora</em> "to like", <em>marsa</em> "to hate", <em>ferad</em> "male slave, slaveboy", <em>fastua</em> "to speak, say", and <em>chanda</em> "she." Note that <em>marsa</em> is a very coarse word, and not one you should use in polite company!</p>
<ol>
	<li>I see that you and I have a goat. <div class="answer">Cambari bostam te gabra so is golne.</div></li>
	<li>You (F.SG) hate how she owns me (F). <div class="answer">Chanda is bosta so rasuinda marsa.</div></li>
	<li>I like that she steals the forest. <div class="answer">Chanda tamande te cambescan so asmari tora.</div></li>
	<li>I (M) say that the slaveboy is beautiful, dude. <div class="answer">Meclistache te ferad so cuala fastua.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in (2) above there are semantic clues what pronouns we should be using. The speaker says she's owned, meaning she's a slave — and she's using the word <em>marsa</em> "to hate" which would be very impolite if she was speaking to a social superior! This means she's almost certainly talking to another slave, hence the use of <em>rasuinda</em> "you female slave."</p>
<p><em>So</em> is not used very often. It's mostly only used with verbs of perception (we'll get into those in the next chapter), communication, and emotion.</p>
<p>There's something important about the sentences above, though: we're not repeating any pronouns. It wouldn't be grammatical to say *<em>Chanda meclistache so chanda fastua</em> or *<em>Chanda is bosta so is marsa</em>. There are three variants of <em>so</em> that we need to learn to be able to say things like "She says she's beautiful" or "I hate that she owns me."</p>
<p>The first is <em>sola</em>. You use <em>sola</em> when the subject of the complement clause is the same as the subject of the <em>matrix clause</em>, the sentence that the complement is embedded in. When you use <em>sola</em>, you don't put the subject in the complement at all. Let's see how this works:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I (F) see I have a goat. <div class="answer">Bosta gabra sola is golne.</div></li>
	<li>You freemen say that you're beautiful. <div class="answer">Meclistache sola raginda fastuam.</div></li>
	<li>I (F) like that I own you (F.SG). <div class="answer">Bosta rasuinda sola enna tora.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>What if the subject of the matrix clause is the same as the <em>object</em> of the complement, though? In this case, we with <em>sone</em>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I (F) like that you're fucking me, slavegirl. <div class="answer">Rasuinda parna sone enna mecua.</div></li>
	<li>I hate how she owns me. <div class="answer">Chanda bosta sone is marsa.</div></li>
	<li>We (F) say that you want us, freewomen. <div class="answer">Inganda mecua sone campende fastua.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we know how to say everything with indicative complementizers… except for one last rare case. What if the subject, object, and matrix subject are <em>all the same?</em> For this, we need <em>soma</em>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I like that I don't own myself. <div class="answer">Bostancua soma is tora.</div></li>
	<li>You hate to fuck yourself, freeman. <div class="answer">Parna soma rachenda marsa.</div></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Soma</em> is very rare, and most people would simply use the normal reflexive pronoun <em>besa</em> with <em>sola,</em> as in <em>Bostancua besa sola is tora.</em> Using <em>soma</em> sounds old-fashioned and sophisticated, especially in Eastern Belad. Not a lot of Beladans actually know how to use <em>soma</em> correctly. Some use <em>soma</em> where <em>so, sola,</em> or <em>sone</em> is required in an attempt to sound formal and respectable; this behavior is called <em>somache</em> and is similar to abuse of "whom" in English.</p>
<p>That's it for the indicative! Next up is <em>ra</em>, the <em>subjunctive,</em> which is used to talk about possibilities or to make suggestions. <em>Ra</em> has exactly the same variants as <em>so</em>, <em>rala, rane,</em> and </em>rama,</em> used in the same way - except than unike <em>soma</em>, <em>rama</em> is still widely used and understood. Verbs <em>ra</em> is used with include <em>vinda</em> "to hope", <em>domma</em> "to need", and <em>rusta</em> "to pray".</p>
<ol>
	<li>I (F) hope you die, freewoman! <div class="answer">Ras corde ra iranda vinda!</div></li>
	<li>You need to go fuck yourself, dude. <div class="answer">Parna rama rachenda domma.</div></li>
	<li>I (F) want to be in the forest. <div class="answer">Ramma te cambescan rala is mecua.</div></li>
	<li>I (M) pray that my uncle does not fuck goats. <div class="answer">Parnancua te tira cuala cha gabra ra cuala rusta.</div></li>
	<li>You want her to fuck you, slavegirl. <div class="answer">Chanda parna rane rasuinda mecua.</div></li>
	<li>I (F) tell you to be fashionable, slaveboy. <div class="answer">Rachenda cardastache ra enna fastua.</div></li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it for this chapter! Come back next time to learn all the gory details of verb conjugation.</p>
