<h1>If You'll Excuse Me</h1>
<p><em>a short story by Lexi Summer Hale</em></p>

<p>“So, on to the next order of business.” Derenhane gestured idly. “The messaging stack.”</p>
<p>Inashkoma groaned. “Here we go,” se muttered.</p>
<p>“Inash,” said Derenhane reprovingly.</p>
<p>“I think we all feel the same way,” I cut in. “We’re all tired of dealing with the CGC.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” said Derenhane. “I’m tired of them too, Sumathaqri. Let’s just get it over with? The longer we spend complaining...” Se trailed off meaningfully.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s time we sent them a message,” said Inashkoma. A few people giggled at the pun. “They propose the same thing every cycle. Can’t we just ignore them?”</p>
<p>“That’s not a precedent I want to set,” said Derenhane. “Besides, do you really want the Conclave on our ass again?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think the Conclave might be tired of them too?” I retorted.</p>
<p>“I <em>think</em> I’d rather formally reject the proposal than spend a week up to my neck in interpersonal politics,” Derenhane shot back. “There’s an Imunorai on this proposal and Imunora has a seat on the Conclave. Do the math, Sumath.”</p>
<p>I folded my arms. “One of these cycles we’re gonna have to have this fight proper.”</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate my ability to procrastinate,” said Derenhane.</p>
<p>Inashkoma snorted. “Fair enough,” se said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be a great big drag,” commented Peshaqrine, who I’d figured would spend the rest of the meeting in the mpare after se’d drifted off during the argument over the new hashing algorithm.  “So we need a formal rejection if we don’t want the Conclave coming after us. Doesn’t mean we have to be polite about it.”</p>
<p>Derenhane laughed. “I like where this is going!”</p>
<p>“What say we make a game of it?” Pesha’s eyes were glinting with a familiar malevolence. “Let’s make it the most devastating rejection letter any task force’s published since the Schisms. Make it <em>very</em> clear what we think of the CGC and their fashion sense.”</p>
<p>I giggled. “Okay, I’m game.”</p>
<p>“Let’s do it,” said Derenhane. Se sent out a shared document to the room, and I jumped in. “Okay. First part of the proposal-”</p>
<p>“Should we do a dramatic reading?” I asked. Inashkoma snickered.</p>
<p>“You and your dramatic readings,” said Pesha.</p>
<p>“A PROPOSAL FOR ENHANCING THE GENERICISM OF THE MESSAGING AND AUTHENTICATION NNNNNETWORK!” roared Derenhane in a respectable imitation of Emperor Manshara from <em>The Deadly Court</em>. I thought Semekshiri was going to fall of ser chair laughing.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,” said Pesha mildly, “that’s enough of that. We’ll be here all week if we keep going.”</p>
<p>“Fair point,” I conceded. “So what’s the preamble?”</p>
<p>“A very long ideological treatise,” said Derenhane. I linked into the proposal. The first sentence alone had seven different words that had been officially deprecated as archaic five cycles ago. <em>Whereby it is in the interests of the greater Thalisa that the mpare be readily usable and accessible to all...</em></p>
<p>“Same as last cycle’s?” asked Semekshiri.</p>
<p>“New one, actually,” I said, running a comparison. “Shit, I think they actually have written a new one every cycle.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose they do this sort of thing for fun?” asked Pesha.</p>
<p>“Ooh, that’s a good one!” said Inashkona. “‘The Task Force would like to politely inquire whether the Committee for Genericism in Communication enjoys writing elaborate ideology treatises, and in particular, whether its members engage in it as a substitute for more rewarding activities, such as maintaining interpersonal relationships’ -”</p>
<p>“-‘updating their wardrobes’-” I interjected.</p>
<p>“Ha! Yes,” said Inashkona, nodding. “-‘updating their wardrobes, or periodically vacating their bowels.’ —Hm, lacks a strong finish.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got one,” said Derenhane after a moment. “‘The Task Force feels that answers to these questions would greatly benefit the field of psychology in its studies of perversities of the mind, and urge the Committee to submit a full and detailed exploration of these questions to the appropriate scholars in the field.’ —Sumath, why are you blushing? Was it something I said?”</p>
<p>“W-what?” I started. “I’m not-” I realized my face felt oddly hot. “I, uh. No, it wasn’t, I think my brain’s just being weird.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha.” Deren nodded. “Okay, that’s a solid start. Should we go over the whole thing or do we want to move on to the actual proposal?”</p>
<p>I stretched, and put my hands in my lap, idling massaging my clit through my p— <em>what the fuck!?</em> I clenched my fist and scanned the room to make sure nobody had noticed. Where in all space had that come from?</p>
<p>“Does anyone else think the temperature in here is a little higher than it says?” I blurted. Everyone stared at me.</p>
<p>“Feels like a decent ten degrees,” said Pesha after a moment. “Sumathaqri, are you quite alright?”</p>
<p>“No. Yes. I’m fine.” I scooted my chair closer to the desk. “Sorry. Maybe I’m just a little overdressed or something.” Maybe I should just strip nake— WHAT.</p>
<p>Where the unholy fuck was this horniness coming fro—?</p>
<p>I fought physically to restrain a gasp. A wave of physical pleasure had shot through my body, and a cheeky voice I knew all too well inserted itself in my mindstream.</p>
<p>“Heya, Sumath!”</p>
<p>“HANA!” I yelled down the channel, biting tightly on my physical lips. “You little shit, what—”</p>
<p>“I’m here! I just got to Araqashma,” se sent. “When I saw you were on the network—”</p>
<p>I dropped fully into the mpare, the conference room fading as the blank white infospace took over my visual cortex. Sure enough, Hanaqeshra’s full avatar was there, no sign of FTL latency. “You’re <em>here?</em> The hell for?”</p>
<p>“Hoverball tournament! Didn’t you hear? What are <em>you</em> doing here?”</p>
<p>“Getting cyber-molested by an mparisea, apparently,” I shot back.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t resist!” Se giggled mischievously. “I was just going to ping you and then I noticed you apparently forgot to pull my backdoor access. Speaking of which—” </p>
<p>Another jolt shot through me. “Aah! Dammit, Hana!” I yanked ser access privileges and the arousal faded.</p>
<p>“For someone on the Mpare Task Force you’ve sure got lousy security habits,” Hana teased.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which,” I snarled, “I am in a <em>meeting</em>!”</p>
<p>“Ooh, awkward,” said Hana, grinning.</p>
<p>“I am going to get you for this,” I vowed.</p>
<p>“Have to catch me first!” Hana giggled, and ser avatar vanished. I pulled back out of the mpare into the real world—</p>
<p>“Sumath!” Derenhane’s voice sounded impatient. “I said, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?” I look around. The entire room was staring at me.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, standing up quickly. “I just got a very important message. Speaking of being on people’s asses, I’ve just learned there’s one on this station that needs a very severe spanking. If you’ll excuse me.”</p>
<p>Deren pouted. “It’ll be half as fun without you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll save you a few subsections, don’t worry,” called Pesha as I flounced from the room.</p>
