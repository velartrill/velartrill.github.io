<h1>Missing</h1>

<p>“She’s still not answering.” Niltar looked away from the terminal. “This isn’t right.”</p>

<p>Livkir paced anxiously. “This is fucked up. We need to — we need to get answers. We need to talk to somebody!”</p>

<p>“Who the fuck are we going to talk to?” Niltar folded her arms tightly, shivering in the cold.</p>

<p>“I — the Judicators? Dispatch? Someone will know!” Livkir looked pleadingly at her. “Come on, Nili, this is Cas we’re talking about, we can’t just —”</p>

<p>“Do you know who took her? Because I sure as fuck don’t!” Niltar leapt down from the comm booth. “If we start asking questions, they might come after us next!”</p>

<p>“No, no, no.” Livkir shook his head. “They couldn’t! We’re citizens! We have rights.”</p>

<p>“Cas is a citizen too, and they took her! Have you ever even seen uniforms like that before? I sure haven’t!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t mean—”</p>

<p>“It means there’s <em>something</em> going on that we were never taught about, Liv! I don’t fucking—”</p>

<p>“What kind of uniforms?”</p>

<p>Niltar stopped at the sound of the quiet voice. She turned, moving next to Livkir to buffer herself against the wind. A boy, younger than either of them, was standing by the tracks. Niltar narrowed her eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you before.”</p>

<p>“Um. Shalcas. We have Firearms together?”</p>

<p>“Okay. Yeah. What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I was just going home. Um. From class. I had Cooking this evening. I heard you talking.” Shalcas looked down, squeezing his wrist nervously. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bother you, I just — I thought I might be able to help? With whatever is going on?”</p>

<p>“Okay. Um.” Niltar looked around wildly. “We should find some shelter. I don’t want to be out talking in this.”</p>

<p>“Let’s head down to the garden.” Livkir took her hand. “It should be pretty empty at this hour.”</p>

<p>Niltar nodded mutely, and let him lead her to the elevator. Shalcas followed behind them, hurrying to match their longer paces.</p>

<p>The portway lit up green as they approached. Livkir hit the contact for the greenhouse level and the glass barrier slid closed, sealing the portway as the elevator departed.</p>

<p>“So. Uh. What happened?” Shalcas looked from Livkir to Niltar. “It sounds bad.”</p>

<p>“A... friend of ours got taken.” Niltar shook her head. “Yesterday morning. She — she still hasn’t pinged us.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Shalcas’ eyes widened. “Wow. I’m sorry. That’s scary. Who took her?”</p>

<p>The elevator slid to a halt and the portway unsealed. Niltar took a deep breath of the warm, fragrant greenhouse air. Livkir struggled out of his jacket.</p>

<p>“Over there,” he said, pointing. “Nili and I usually study over there.”</p>

<p>A gardener tending one of the young trees gave them a friendly wave as they passed. Niltar waved back nervously.</p>

<p>“Do you think they’re following us?” she whispered, looking at Livkir. “They could have us all flagged. I mean, fuck, they might have gotten into our comm records! They could be following everybody Cas knows!”</p>

<p>“Nili. Nili, calm down.” Livkir squeezed her shoulder. “We can’t jump to conclusions like that.”</p>

<p>“Why the fuck not? We don’t even know who they were! We have no idea what they might be capable of!”</p>

<p>“You can’t even get into the records without like. <em>Crazy</em> high clearance. We’re talking Big Three-level here. It’s all encrypted.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s what they <em>tell us!”</em> hissed Niltar. “How do we know it’s true?”</p>

<p>“Trust me, it’s there! It’s the first thing they showed me when they apprenticed me into Networking. I’ve seen the code myself. They don’t want us getting ideas we can spy on our friends, you know?” He grinned weakly.</p>

<p>Niltar sat down on a bench, pulling Livkir down beside her. Shalcas perched across from them. “Look. We don’t know what they’re capable of. We have to—”</p>

<p>“Assume the worst?” Livkir shook his head. “Nili, if we assume the worst, there’s <em>nothing we can do!</em> If the Triumvirate decided it wanted to screw us over, we’d have no way to fight back. You know that. We have to trust them. Trust that they wouldn’t come after us without a reason.”</p>

<p>“You said you didn’t recognize their uniforms?” Shalcas interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Yeah, um.” Niltar pursed her lips. “Like. Okay. Sure. The Judicators have gotten on Cas’s case before, but nobody’s <em>ever</em> come and forced their way into the dormitories like that. Nobody ever <em>took</em> her before!”</p>

<p>“What did they look like? Can you remember how they were dressed?”</p>

<p>“Um.” Niltar looked at Livkir. “Leather, right? Like. Green and gray. No stripes, no badges. They just walked right past every lock like they had a right to be there.”</p>

<p>Shalcas’ eyes widened. “Oh. Oh shit.”</p>

<p>“You recognize that?” Niltar jumped up. “Who are they?”</p>

<p>“That’s, uh.” Shalcas went pale. “That’s the Shevran.”</p>

<p>“You’re shitting me.” Livkir stared. “The <em>Shevran?</em> I thought they were like. Really high up. Like you’d never see them if you weren’t in spitting distance of the Big Three.”</p>

<p>“How do you know this? Have you seen them before?” Niltar demanded, looking at Shalcas.</p>

<p>Shalcas nodded. “Yeah.” He looked down. “I’m not really supposed to talk about this, but I — well — I grew up in Varshal.”</p>

<p><em>“Shit.”</em> Niltar whistled.</p>

<p>“Varshal?” Livkir looked at her. “I don’t get it. Where’s that?”</p>

<p>“It <em>isn’t;</em> that’s the point, dumbass. It’s what Lismad used to be.”</p>

<p>“Used to — oh! Wow, okay. I had no idea Lismad was a refounding. What the shit happened in Varshal?”</p>

<p>“It was bad,” Shalcas murmured. “The Shevran swept in and called blank slate. Confined some of the leaders, sent others to reeducation. They dispersed most of us to other <em>rantalar.”</em></p>

<p>“Wow. I’m so sorry.” Niltar sat back down. “I can’t imagine what that must have been like.”</p>

<p>“Like I said, I’m not supposed to talk about it.” Shalcas looked down. “But the Shevran — it’s not just corruption they go after. It’s sedition too. If your friend isn’t an official, then that’s what they took her for. They think she’s a threat to the People.”</p>

<p>“Cassil. Her name’s Cassil.” Niltar stared at the cobblestone path. “And she’s more than just my friend. Damn it, Cas, you should have known your big mouth was going to get you in trouble some day. <em>Damn it!”</em></p>

<p>“Okay. So this is big. That doesn’t mean we have to freak out.” Livkir took her hand. “I still say we go to Dispatch.”</p>

<p>“Why the <em>fuck</em> would we do that? If it’s this big, how can we trust them?”</p>

<p>“If it’s this big, we <em>have</em> to trust them! Come on, Nili. Be real. What can we do on our own? We have to trust <em>somebody!”</em></p>

<p><em>“Fine!”</em> Niltar pushed him away. “Fine. We’ll talk to Dispatch. We’ll probably just get ourselves taken too, but whatever.”</p>

<p>“Can I come with?” Shalcas piped up suddenly. “Maybe I could help.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Yeah, that’s good. He knows the Shevran, right?” Livkir nodded. “Maybe he can help us get her back.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Niltar muttered.</p>
