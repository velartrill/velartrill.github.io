<h1>Rescue</h1>
<p><em>from a serial by Lexi Summer Hale</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody in this fic the main character doesn&rsquo;t have sex with at some point?&rdquo; asked Maranqura Derosdeshai Sefannai, scanning the text and raising a bemused eyebrow.</p>
<p>The pilot&rsquo;s avatar shook ser head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so &mdash; wait, maybe Qlesextius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virchsex. Last chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhh, right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is dumb.&rdquo; Maranqura rolled her eyes. &ldquo;The Empire hasn&rsquo;t got anything like that level of virch tech; did the writer even bother thinking about anything that was going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to figure out that the Imperial language doesn&rsquo;t have the &lsquo;quh&rsquo; sound, so probably not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riiight,&rdquo; Maraqura snapped her fingers. &ldquo;I wondered why these names sounded so off. &mdash;Oh good <em>grief</em> are you <em>serious&mdash;&ldquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you just got to the dinner party, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, what the <em>hell ass balls&mdash;</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty sure Imperials don&rsquo;t even have the right body parts for that,&rdquo; commented the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough.&rdquo; Maranqura closed the manuscript with a violent gesture, the text flickering away with some extra visual effects for emphasis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going on the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s ten, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so. Hells, Sumath, I swear they get worse every cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anurdosa is going to <em>love</em> this one; se always has fun playing aristocrats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Qlesextius even get a gender? I didn&rsquo;t see it mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sumathaqri cocked ser head. &ldquo;<em>Thal&rsquo;</em>, you know, I don&rsquo;t even think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ooh, look at me, I&rsquo;m gonna write a fic where Sharakir gets tangled up in Imperial politics and I&rsquo;m not even gonna do enough research to figure out that Imperial characters have to have a fuckin&rsquo; gender!&rsquo;&rdquo; said Maranqura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Sharakir gets ser ass dragged all over the galaxy,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, the fans want to see sim doing everything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and most of them can&rsquo;t write the character worth a damn, so se loses every quality that makes sim entertaining,&rdquo; finished Maranqura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Sumathaqri grinned. &ldquo;<em>Thal&rsquo;</em>, I can only imagine the sort of havoc this Hashruikir person could have wrecked on the narrative if se&rsquo;d gotten ser hands on an Imperial dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Eww,</em> I did not need that image.&rdquo; Maranqura pantomimed throwing up. &ldquo;Not one of us would make it through a single page without dying of laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except maybe Suan,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;That cagey shit managed to make it through three whole paragraphs of <em>The Ashen Bones of Distant Glory</em> without even chuckli&mdash; <em>well</em>, somebody wants to get a hold of you in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleaming indicator had blinked into existence between them. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; said Maranqura, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re still off grid, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;Must have prepped a buoy specially. Should I let you take this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maranqura nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. Sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem; let me know when you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; Sumathaqri&rsquo;s avatar winked out of existence.</p>
<p>Maranqura summoned the comms screen. A manifest spilled out in front of her, crammed with logs; it looked like part of a case file. She glanced at the origin. It was from the Transit Task Force, with an unfamiliar name &mdash; &ldquo;Shishara&rdquo;. She opened the main message.</p>
<p><em>Hi, Maranqura. Sorry to dump more on you at the last minute, but a ship, the </em>Forward Edge of Infinity<em>, just went dark in your region and you&rsquo;re the closest forces in the area. Will you be able to take a look?</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No problem, Shishara,&rdquo;</em> Maranqura sent back. <em>&ldquo;The mothership needs to keep orbit around Kurasan, but I&rsquo;ll send out a skiff or two.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; </em>came the reply half a riaqa later. <em>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Maranqura scanned the archive briefly to make sure nothing was classified, then pinged Sumathaqri. Ser avatar reappeared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s gone dark about ten qiyal rimwards of us,&rdquo; said Maranqura. &ldquo;Transit wants us to take a look.&rdquo; She linked Sumathaqri in to the message so se could see it on ser end. &ldquo;Can we &rsquo;port out a few skiffs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri, scanning the manifest. &ldquo;Are we expecting resistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be. Ships don&rsquo;t go dark very often. But I mean, it could just be a prank, for all we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I pre-comp a return jump just in case?&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;I mean I doubt there&rsquo;s a Society invasion fleet on the other end but I&rsquo;d like to send our people in with an escape route ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maranqura hesitated, and ran the math. 11.6 qiyal by the volume of a skiff would take about 13 riaqa if they put most of the onboard processor time to the task; so double that for the return trip&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess another 13 ri&rsquo; probably isn&rsquo;t going to make a huge difference.&rdquo; She glanced at the ship&rsquo;s nav. &ldquo;Do we jump first or do the skiffs? We still have one left to go before we&rsquo;re in the Kurasan system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well, we&rsquo;ve got most of the jump calc done for the whole ship, so it&rsquo;ll save us some time. Actually, I think &mdash; yeah, it&rsquo;ll shave some time off the return calculations too. So we can have the skiffs out in 24 riaqa instead of 26.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, sounds good. &hellip;Hopefully nobody dies in those extra 11 riaqa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your call, Maran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know. I mean, probably either they&rsquo;re dead already or they&rsquo;ll keep for a bit longer, so it&rsquo;s probably safe.&rdquo; She glanced at the nav. Four riaqa to jump. &ldquo;These past few mroqa have just been so encouraging, haven&rsquo;t they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me. I know somebody on Kurasan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; Maranqura started. &ldquo;You never told me. You know them as a&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mparisea,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;And a close one, too. Met in a hoverball virch a few cycles ago when we were both at the Hub. Se beat my ass like a pro, and we struck up a conversation while I was nursing my swollen pride. It turned out we had a lot of things besides sports in common, and, well, then se <em>literally</em> beat my ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; said Maranqura. &ldquo;Is se doing okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sumathaqri nodded. &ldquo;Last I heard. The worst that happened to sim was losing a leg to a girder; se got off lucky compared to most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I read the reports.&rdquo; Maranqura shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not often we&hellip; y&rsquo;know, <em>lose</em> people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thal&rsquo;</em>, Maran, just &mdash;&nbsp;don&rsquo;t even go there,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to be thinking about that right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, sorry. I&rsquo;ll find someone else to vent to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Maranqura sighed. &ldquo;I think we got soft, y&rsquo;know? We just got used to taking worlds from the Empire, and they were already tame, they were just a mess. Not like this, where we don&rsquo;t know when the fucking geography is going to bite&mdash;&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re the timetables for the evacuation with two skiffs out of the action?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unchanged,&rdquo; said Sumathaqri after a moment. &ldquo;People might not be too comfortable on the lift out but we&rsquo;ve still got enough skiffs to take them all in five trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Sorry, where was I? &mdash;Oh, I was going to say, think that mparisea of yours would want to join the dramatic reading party tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sumathaqri shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; it&rsquo;s not really ser kind of thing. We connected more over sports and physical stuff than, um, love of terrible fanfic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we can find a few people it would cheer up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get the feeling you feel pretty bad for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Thal&rsquo;</em>, Sumath, of course I do. They just physically lost their ashtisa and&hellip; <em>lost</em> a few people they knew. They&rsquo;ve been camped out in the snow for what, ten mroqa now? They didn&rsquo;t sign up for that.&rdquo;</p>
