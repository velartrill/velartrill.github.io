<p>The engineered language of the Society of Worlds.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>‹c› is always hard (/k/, not /s/)</li>
	<li>‹r› is like an American ‹r› (not a Spanish ‹r›) but slightly lighter; /ɹˠ/ instead of /ɻ/. It can also be pronounced as [ɹ͡ɣ]; that is, a British ‹r› coarticulated with an intervocalic Spanish ‹g› (as in <i>pague</i>).</li>
	<li>‹s› is pronounced /z/ between vowels, as in Italian, except where doubled.</li>
	<li>Initial stops are not aspirated: there is no puff of air after /t/ or /k/ like there is at the start of English words.</li>
	<li>At the end of a syllable, unless followed by a vowel (including across word boundaries), /t/ and /d/ have <em>fricative release</em> — that is, they're pronounced as [ts] and [dz] respectively.</li>
	<li>See the <a href="ranuir.html">reference grammar</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of how to pronounce Ranuir, including in dialects besides Core.</li>

		<div id="ranuir.d.varshol"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.varshol">varshol</a></b> the system of <a href="#ranuir.d.var"><i>var</i></a> relationships that structure the Society, encompassing aspects of ethics, interpersonal responsibility, cultural practices, language use, and the expression, function, establishment, and manipulation of the dominance contexts at the heart of the system. in the context of this glossary, <i>varshol</i> tags words that are significant parts of how the system signifies, communicates, and expresses itself, such as vocabulary with explicit dominance polarities.</div>

		<div id="ranuir.d.sahshol"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.sahshol">sahshol</a></b> the system of command authority and responsibility in the Society's formal hierarchy, including the duties of subordinates <i>(minar sahani)</i> and of superiors <i>(minar sahini)</i>. it also refers to the cultural, linguistic, and practical ways this system expresses itself, ranging from words used to navigate and participate in the system, to military courtesy and discipline, to the design and wearing of uniforms.</div>

(for example, a <i>vartash</i> might be authorized to physically restrain a <i>selin</i> given to suicidal or self-harming impulses.) in general, a <i>selin</i> assigns a <i>vartash</i> gives up some (or in extreme cases, all) of her freedom in exchange for stability, care, and comfort. <i>vartash</i> relationships are long-term and a very serious commitment that can only be dissolved in exceptional circumstances, such as long-term remission of symptoms coupled with the consent of both partners (though renegotiation is common).

		<div id="ranuir.d.lan"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.lan">lan</a></b> roughly, “decision-labor.” <i>lan</i> is the work of making choices, selecting and giving direction, taking responsibility for oneself or for others. in some ways analogous to “leadership.” <i>lan</i> is seen as a particularly burdensome and selfless form of labor. should not be used to mean political power; see <i><a href="#ranuir.d.lanuas">lanuas</a></i>.
		</div>

		<div id="ranuir.d.lanuas"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.lanuas">lanuas</a></b> the misperformance of the duty of <i><a href="#ranuir.d.lan">lan</a></i>, particularly by making decisions for others in such as a way as to personally profit.
		</div>

		<div id="ranuir.d.riv"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.riv">riv</a></b> in Society culture, a <i>riv</i> is an action disharmonious to the unity and wellbeing of the People: broadly, an “offense.” <i>riv</i> as a category contrasts with <i>evsurin</i>: while <i>evsurinen</i> is the conscious, willful betrayal of the People and one's comrades, <i>riven</i> is more thoughtless, smaller-scope, having more to do with interpersonal disharmony than politics or personal enrichment. while betrayal is handled mercilessly at a very high level, with openly punitive intent, <i>riv</i> is usually a matter handled between counselors and the local militia, with a restorative and rehabilitative intent.

		<div id="ranuir.d.ias"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.ias">ias</a></b> a particular category of <i><a href="#ranuir.d.riv">riv</a></i> dealing with the broad category of intrusion and violation.

		<div id="ranuir.d.latias"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.latias">latias</a></b> bodily intrusion or violation. a broad category but often used semi-euphemistically to refer to rape (less euphemistically known as <i><a href="#ranuir.d.iastesh">iastesh</a>.)</i> <i>latias</i> is committed when one forces their will on another’s body against their explicit refusal. it is not as broad a category as assault; bodily contact even between strangers is part of the norms of Society body language, and citizens are not regarded as having an absolute right to freedom from unwanted contact, any more than an American has the right to be free of hearing the voices of others on the street. attacks on others are also not automatically considered an offense; physical combat (within strict limits, any damage beyond bruising or minor breaks or lacerations are forbidden) is to the Society an acceptable and pro-social way to resolve conflict. however, outside this limited context, physical assault is considered <i>latias</i> as well.

		<div id="ranuir.d.iastesh"><b><a href="#ranuir.d.iastesh">iastesh</a></b> a certain kind of sexual assault approaching rape, less focused on the sexual aspect and more on the aspect of forced intimacy with an intruder. the sex act referred to by <i>tesh</i> is less about intercourse, which may or may not occur, and more about catharsis, reinforcement of hierarchy, and the breaking down of defenses and barriers; the central violation of <i>iastesh</i> is therefore being having one’s defenses torn down by an intruder. for instance, the ongoing sexual aggression between Cassil and Lisuan increasingly approaches this. differs from <i><a href="#ranuir.d.lahtesh">lahtesh</a></i> in that the latter is fundamentally and wholly consensual.

<h2 id="ziatai">Zia Ţai</h2>
<p>The language of the Zyahua <i>(zia hua)</i> people, and the official language of the Empire, in which the Zyahua are an ethnic majority.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>The phonology of Zia Ţai is very alien relative to English and the orthography is relatively complex, so pronunciations are simply shown next to individual words.</p>
<h3>Lexicon</h3>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Imperial words require special "singulative markers" to indicate that a noun does not refer to a collective or unspecified number. Where relevant, the appropriate singulative is listed in parentheses.

<h2 id="thalishte">Thalishte</h2>
<p>The common language of the Thalisan Union.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Initial stops are unaspirated; that is, word-initial sounds like /p t k/ are pronounced without the characteristic puff of air heard in English.</li>
	<li>The digraph ‹th› is always pronounced [θ] as in "thing", never [ð] as in "the".</li>
	<li>The letter ‹q› is pronounced [q] as in Arabic قط.</li>
	<li>The codas /m n/ must be distinguished from syllabic nasals /m̩ n̩~ɴ̩/. ‹m n› are always syllabic word-initially when they appear before another consonant (that is, they are pronounced as a syllable unto the themselves). They are also syllabic when they appear after an open syllable, marked with an acute accent ‹´› where necessary for disambiguation. Thus, <i>nqanthe</i> is phonemically /n̩.qɑn.θe/ and pronounced [ɴ̩ˈqɑnθe], whereas <i>nqánthe</i> is phonemically /n̩.qɑ.n̩.θe/ and pronounced [ɴ̩qɑˈn̩θe].</li>
	<li>In fluent speech, /n/ and /n̩/ assimilate to any following consonant, becoming [ŋ] before /k g/ and [ɴ] before /q/.</li>
	<li>‹r› is pronounced [ɾ] as in American English "bu<strong>tt</strong>er" or Spanish <i>pero</i>, <strong>not</strong> <i>perro</i> or English "road".</li>
	<li>‹h› is pronounced [h] as in English. It is never silent.</li>
	<li>‹sh› is pronounced [ʃ] as in English "sheep".</li>
	<li>‹ch› is pronounced [t͡ʃ] as in English "cheap," never as in "chaos" or "chauvinistic".</li>
	<li>‹s› is always pronounced [s] is in "seed", never [z] as in "dogs".</li>
