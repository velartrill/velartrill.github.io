<h2>Ranuir</h2>
<p>The engineered language of the Society of Worlds.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>‹c› is always hard (/k/, not /s/)</li>
	<li>‹r› is like an American ‹r› (not a Spanish ‹r›) but slightly lighter; /ɹˠ/ instead of /ɻ/. It can also be pronounced as [ɹ͡ɣ]; that is, a British ‹r› coarticulated with an intervocalic Spanish ‹g› (as in <i>pague</i>)</li>
	<li>‹s› is pronounced /z/ between vowels, as in Italian.</li>
	<li>Initial stops are not aspirated: there is no puff of air after /t/ or /k/ like there is at the start of English words.</li>
	<li>Each vowel has a <em>broad</em> pronunciation and a <em>slender</em> pronunciation. The broad pronunciations are similar to Swahili with the exception of ‹e›. which is always pronounced [ɛ] (as in "kept"). The slender pronunciations are similar to English except for /o/, which has the slender allophone [ʌ], and /u/, which has the slender allophone [ʊ] (as in "could"). Broad allophones are normally used, but slender allophones are used when the vowel appears next to the sound /j/ (as in "yew") or /ʃ/ (as in "sheep").</li>
</ul>
