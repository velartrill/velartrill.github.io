<h2 id="ranuir">Ranuir</h2>
<p>The engineered language of the Society of Worlds.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>‹c› is always hard (/k/, not /s/)</li>
	<li>‹r› is like an American ‹r› (not a Spanish ‹r›) but slightly lighter; /ɹˠ/ instead of /ɻ/. It can also be pronounced as [ɹ͡ɣ]; that is, a British ‹r› coarticulated with an intervocalic Spanish ‹g› (as in <i>pague</i>).</li>
	<li>‹s› is pronounced /z/ between vowels, as in Italian, except where doubled.</li>
	<li>Initial stops are not aspirated: there is no puff of air after /t/ or /k/ like there is at the start of English words.</li>
	<li>At the end of a syllable, unless followed by a vowel (including across word boundaries), /t/ and /d/ have <em>fricative release</em> — that is, they're pronounced as [ts] and [dz] respectively.</li>
	<li>See the <a href="ranuir.html">reference grammar</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of how to pronounce Ranuir, including in dialects besides Core.</li>

		<div><b>-at</b> <i>adlocative marker</i></strong></div>
		<div><b>-e</b> on verbs, marks the indicative mood.</strong></div>
		<div><b>-im</b> on verbs, marks a direct order, carrying the weight of the speaker's formal role and authority within the Society's hierarchy, and accepting all responsibility for the outcome of the order. not simply an imperative and <strong>not to be used lightly.</strong></div>

		<div id="ranuir.d.san"><b>san</b> “you,” “ma'am,” “sir.” indicates deference towards the listener, accepting their authority and placing oneself under it. not usually used in intimate contexts. sometimes used between friends, though usually only in an emergency or other situation in which one person is giving explicit orders, no matter the dominance context or use of <i><a href="#ranuir.d.elen">elen</a>/<a href="#ranuir.d.val">val</a>.</i>

		<div id="ranuir.d.ash"><b>ash</b> “you,” “hon.” expresses dominance over the listener. unlike <a href="#ranuir.d.val"><i>val</i></a> which is a relatively gentle, reassuring expression of dominance, <i>ash</i> is extremely assertive. if a dominance context has not already been established, use of <i>ash</i> is incredibly risky, verging on a breach of ettiquette. where <i>val</i> offers gentle reinforcement and support that need neither be explicitly acknowledged or accepted, <i>ash</i> stakes a claim on the addressee, whose only options are to accept it or push back assertively.

		<div id="ranuir.d.var"><b>var</b> literally "shadow," figuratively connotating a relationship of dominance and submission. the concept <i>var</i> expresses is complex and tightly interwoven with core Society ideology. in short, <i>var</i> is the relationship between a superior <i>(varin)</i> and an inferior <i>(selin</i> or more specifically <i>varan)</i>: the duty of loving care and protection on one hand, and the duty of obedience and respect on the other.

		<div id="ranuir.d.varshol"><b>varshol</b> the system of <a href="#ranuir.d.var"><i>var</i></a> relationships that structure the Society, encompassing aspects of ethics, interpersonal responsibility, cultural practices, language use, and the expression, function, establishment, and manipulation of the dominance contexts at the heart of the system. in the context of this glossary, <i>varshol</i> tags words that are significant parts of how the system signifies, communicates, and expresses itself, such as vocabulary with explicit dominance polarities.</div>
		<div id="ranuir.d.sahshol"><b>sahshol</b> the system of command authority and responsibility in the Society's formal hierarchy, including the duties of subordinates <i>(minar sahani)</i> and of superiors <i>(minar sahini)</i>. it also refers to the cultural, linguistic, and practical ways this system expresses itself, ranging from words used to navigate and participate in the system, to military courtesy and discipline, to the design and wearing of uniforms.</div>
		<div id="ranuir.d.vartash"><b>vartash</b> a "guardian;" a (usually) older member of a cohort assigned to care for and protect a younger member identified as having social and/or mental health difficulties. this relationship creates various duties <i>(minar)</i> between the pair, and a <i>vartash</i> is given a degree of formal authority over her charge (her <i>selin)</i>. the exact degree of authority is negotiated by the pair and their counselor as appropriate to the needs and issues of the <i>selin</i>. (for example, a <i>vartash</i> might be authorized to physically restrain a <i>selin</i> given to suicidal or self-harming impulses.) in general, a <i>selin</i> assigned a <i>vartash</i> gives up some (or in extreme cases, all) of her freedom in exchange for stability, care, and comfort. <i>vartash</i> relationships are long-term and a very serious commitment that can only be dissolved in exceptional circumstances, such as long-term remission of symptoms coupled with the consent of both partners (though renegotiation is common).

<h2 id="ziatai">Zia Ţai</h2>
<p>The language of the Zyahua <i>(zia hua)</i> people, and the official language of the Empire, in which the Zyahua are an ethnic majority.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>The phonology of Zia Ţai is very alien relative to English and the orthography is relatively complex, so pronunciations are simply shown next to individual words.</p>
<h3>Lexicon</h3>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Imperial words require special "singulative markers" to indicate that a noun does not refer to a collective or unspecified number. Where relevant, the appropriate singulative is listed in parentheses.

<h2 id="thalishte">Thalishte</h2>
<p>The common language of the Thalisan Union.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Initial stops are unaspirated; that is, word-initial sounds like /p t k/ are pronounced without the characteristic puff of air heard in English.</li>
	<li>The digraph ‹th› is always pronounced [θ] as in "thing", never [ð] as in "the".</li>
	<li>The letter ‹q› is pronounced [q] as in Arabic قط.</li>
	<li>The codas /m n/ must be distinguished from syllabic nasals /m̩ n̩~ɴ̩/. ‹m n› are always syllabic word-initially when they appear before another consonant (that is, they are pronounced as a syllable unto the themselves). They are also syllabic when they appear after an open syllable, marked with an acute accent ‹´› where necessary for disambiguation. Thus, <i>nqanthe</i> is phonemically /n̩.qɑn.θe/ and pronounced [ɴ̩ˈqɑnθe], whereas <i>nqánthe</i> is phonemically /n̩.qɑ.n̩.θe/ and pronounced [ɴ̩qɑˈn̩θe].</li>
	<li>In fluent speech, /n/ and /n̩/ assimilate to any following consonant, becoming [ŋ] before /k g/ and [ɴ] before /q/.</li>
	<li>‹r› is pronounced [ɾ] as in American English "bu<strong>tt</strong>er" or Spanish <i>pero</i>, <strong>not</strong> <i>perro</i> or English "road".</li>
	<li>‹h› is pronounced [h] as in English. It is never silent.</li>
	<li>‹sh› is pronounced [ʃ] as in English "sheep".</li>
	<li>‹ch› is pronounced [t͡ʃ] as in English "cheap," never as in "chaos" or "chauvinistic".</li>
	<li>‹s› is always pronounced [s] is in "seed", never [z] as in "dogs".</li>
</ul>
