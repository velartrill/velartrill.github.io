<h1>The Camps <em>[WIP]</em></h1>
<div class="byline">from a serial by Lexi Summer Hale</div>
<p>Savren can’t help but let out a cry this time as the whip bites deep into her bare back. Her wrists twist frantically in the iron manacles holding them high over her head, muscles spasming in her shoulders. She can feel something wet dripping down her back. Blood.</p>
<p>“You freaks do feel pain after all.” A towering woman, half-silhoutted in the gloom, folds her arms, glowering down at the shirtless, helpless little soldier. “How many, Owl?”</p>
<p>“Fifteen, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Sputtering torches mounted on the harsh stone walls cast an eerie, fluttering light through the otherwise dark chamber. Shadows dance before Savren’s frightened eyes, shadows of pillars, of the pitiless chains, of human figures moving around her — her mind too foggy to count them. What light there is illuminates little more than stone and blood — fresh and old.</p>
<p>These chains have held many victims.</p>
<p>“Fifteen lashes just to get a noise out of you. If you didn’t bleed red, I’d think you weren’t human.”</p>
<p>Savren says nothing, squeezing her eyes shut, trying to hold back the tears.</p>
<p>“You know what the Empress wants to do with your kind?” The intendant clasps her hands behind her back, stalking out of Savren’s eyesight. Her voice reverberates from behind. “A whole nation of you, all hale and hearty and strong as a moon-mad pien şai? She has a mind to glut the slave markets with your race. Thinks she’ll rake in the billions selling you off to the factories, man, woman, and child.”</p>
<p>An exasperated sigh. “She has such a cozy view of it, so far away on the throne. You know what I think, rat?” Savren’s head jerks back, a hand gripping her tightly by the hair. “I think she should put every last one of you to the sword,” the intendant whispers in her ear. “Drown the galaxy in your blood. Your worlds are profit enough. You’ll never be tamed. Wild. Feral. Can’t stop your scheming even if your life depends on it. It’s in the blood. Your breed is more trouble than it’s worth.” She yanks harder, enough to make Savren yelp, then lets go.</p>
<p>Savren grits her teeth. “Go f-fuck yourself.”</p>
<p>The intendant snaps her fingers and Savren’s body shudders with the force of another stroke. Her nerves scream, like a white-hot lance is cutting a line across her back. Bullets don’t hurt this much.</p>
<p>“So here I am. I’ve got quotas, me. Per prisoner. And Greens count double.” The intendant backhands Savren across the face, her mailed hand impacting hard enough to bruise. “So what’s a woman to do? I’ve had five of you put down already this season. The General is getting impatient with me. ‘You’re supposed to be working them to death, Egret, not shooting them to death,’ she tells me. A camp full of scheming heretics I’m not allowed to kill. God give me strength!”</p>
<p>She crouches down, eyes level with Savren. “So here’s how it’s to be, lovely. The next time I catch a Green rabble-rousing or poking around where she’s not meant to be, I’m going to bring you in here, and you’re going to whip her yourself. Or watch while I put a bullet in her head.” She takes Savren by the chin. “You understand? Or do I got to say it slower for your little barbarian brain?”</p>
<p>Savren spits in her face.</p>
<p>Egret stands slowly, eyes fixed stoically on the younger woman. She picks up Savren’s own tunic from where it lays discarded, wipes her face, tosses it aside. Then with a sudden, savage blow, she slams her armored fist into the soldier’s stomach.</p>
<p>Savren stumbles, losing her footing, tendons in her wrists burning as the shackles grip them. She gags, vomit roiling up and out of her mouth, splattering against the stone floor. Her head swims. She can feel blood trickling down her waist.</p>
<p>Egret turns on her heel and walks away. She pauses at the entrance, glances at the guard captain. “Ten more,” she says dispassionately, and then the iron doors slam behind her.</p>
<p>Savren closes her eyes.</p>
<p>By the time it’s over, the pain is all Savren can feel. Her throat is hoarse from screaming and sobbing and begging; burned from vomiting until there’s nothing left in her stomach but acid. She stumbles as the guard unlocks the cuffs and drags her out of the room, falls to her knees as she’s pushed out into the bright, cold morning air, gravel scraping at her skin, more blood staining the ground. She curls up there, against the wall, body shaking so hard it feels like a seizure, head awash in noise. She gasps for breath, digging her nails into her leg to try and distract herself from her torn back. <em>It’s even worse than the night they took us.</em></p>
<p><em>How can this much pain fit into a space as small as the galaxy?</em></p>
<p>“Savi!” She feels gentle hands on her body, instinctively tensing up at the unannounced touch, looks up wildly to see the form of a young Zyahua man—</p>
<p>“O-Otter,” she murmurs, burrying her head in her hands, the fear fading as quickly as it had come. “…I…’m…s-s-sorry.”</p>
<p>“God within, what did they— how many times—”</p>
<p>“…a lot.”</p>
<p>“Can you move your legs? I need to get you back to the bunks—”</p>
<p>Savren shakes her head. “W-why are you here? You sh-sh-should be on the lines…” She’s starting to feel delirious. “…they’re not going to feed you tonight—”</p>
<p>“Fuck that, comrade. Come on.” Otter slips an arm through her arms and pulls her gently to her feet. “You’re more important.”</p>
<p>“…nothing you can do for me…”</p>
<p>“I can probably fuck some opium out of a guard—”</p>
<p>Savren recoils, unwanted memories welling up. “Don’t… please…” She can feel their hands on her skin again, hear their laughter. She flinches, instinctively trying to cover her own breasts with her arms. “N-nothing is worth that.”</p>
<p>“How are you even breathing? God, forget it, just— let me get you to a bed?”</p>
<p>Passing laborers stop to stare as the two pass by. Bare-chested, drenched in her own blood, stumbling erratically, and still they salute her. Savren hates herself. <em>I’m supposed to be strong for them.</em></p>
<p>The rough little cot is a welcome respite. Otter lets her down gently, but she still lets out a small mewl as each wound presses up against the fabric. He drapes her tunic across her chest, trying to give her as much dignity as he can.</p>
<p>“What <em>happened,</em> Savi?”</p>
<p>“One of the workers… d-decided a few warm dinners was w-worth more than the cause.”</p>
<p>“Someone <em>turned you in?”</em></p>
<p>“Stars, this place… turns people into animals.”</p>
<p>Otter squeezes her hand. “Before you came… I was really considering just taking my chances and walking.”</p>
<p>Savren shakes her head. “The… nearest settlement is seventy leagues away.” She closes her eyes. “You’d die of exposure. You’d never get there.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I figured.” Otter stares at the ground. “Still better than this.”</p>
<p>Savren suddenly picks up a sound, a distant, growing roar. Overhead. Instinctively, her head jerks up, but there’s nothing to see but the roof. <em>Hallucinating. I’m hallucinating. It can’t be real.</em></p>
<p>But Otter’s eyes go wide. “Is that—” he breathes.</p>
<p>“…you can hear it too?”</p>
<p>The roar grows and grows, reaches an abrupt crescendo. As it starts to fade, shouts begin to rise outside.</p>
<p>“Go!” Savren urges, her heart suddenly racing.</p>
<p>Otter rushes from the bunk. The shouting intensifies. Savren flinches at the sound of a gunshot. A sidearm.</p>
<p>“Six flares!” Otter dashes back inside, his eyes wild. “The drone sent up six flares, it’s— it’s just like you said—”</p>
<p>Adrenaline surges and Savren forces herself into a sitting position, heedless of the pain consuming her. “You’re— it’s really— novas above, I was starting to think—”</p>
<p>“They’re here. They’re really here!”</p>
<p>Even through the blinding agony Savren can’t help but grin. “I didn’t… oh, <em>wow.</em> I n-never thought it would be like <em>this.”</em> She grabs for her tunic, shakily pulls it down over her chest as she tries to stand. “The day finally comes and I’m too broken to fight.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to us. You’ve sacrificed enough already.” Otter gently pushes her back down and claps her on the shoulder. She smiles faintly at him and returns the gesture.</p>
<p><i>“Tam surinte,</i> Otter.”</p>
<p>Otter beams. <i>“Sav citte, Savren.”</i></p>
<p>“S-spoken like a native.” Savren leans back against the wall. “Stars and skies. Stay safe out there. I would never have gotten through this without you.”</p>
<p>“Right back at you, Commander.” Otter flashes her a salute and darts back out the door.</p>
<p>Savren leans back against the wall, and listens to the sounds of battle grow.</p>
<p> <hr></p>
<p>Egret is in her office when the noise begins, towelling Savren’s blood off her armor. She looks up in time to see the drone streak across the sky, leaving dots of light in its wake, so bright they bathe the camp in an eerie green glow.</p>
<p>She stumbles to her feet, backing away on instinct. The guard at her door shields her eyes against the brilliance in the sky.</p>
<p>“What in all ash was that!?” Egret howls, pointing. “Are— are them Greens <em>bombing</em> us?”</p>
<p>“Those aren’t bombs, ma’am…”</p>
<p>“Then what <em>are</em> they, Owl?”</p>
<p>“Flares, I think, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“…what are they <em>for?”</em></p>
<p>“Buggered if I know, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Egret growls. “Get all shifts out of the barracks and ready to fight. Go!”</p>
<p>The captain salutes and rushes from the the room. Egret steps closer to the window, putting a hand on the hilt of her sword.</p>
<p><em>What in ash—</em></p>
<p>Laborers are filling the yard, boiling up out of the mine and the workhouses. Men and women, side by side. Swarming. She hears a gunshot, turns in time to see the throng closing on a hapless private, pummelling her in a moment. Egret takes a few steps back, then turns and begins to run.</p>
<p>“Lock down the bunker!” she shouts at her staff as she passes. “Guards on every entry! Seal those blast-doors!” <em>What in ash are the idiots</em> thinking? <em>There’s no way</em> out—</p>
<p>Egret freezes in her tracks, the pieces suddenly clicking together. <em>The drone.</em> She turns, and sprints for the telegram office.</p>
<p>The clerk looks up in alarm as she slams through the door. “Get me a message through to the depot <em>now!”</em> she barks. “The prisoners are rebelling; we’re under attack!”</p>
<p>The clerk’s eyes widen. “Y-yes, ma’am! At once, ma’am.” She snatches a fresh message sheet and begins scribbling. “Shall we copy to the General?”</p>
<p>Egret hesitates. “I… n-no… no need to involve the General yet, I’m… sure we’ll, uh. Contain the situation.”</p>
<p>“Of course, ma’am. As you will.”</p>
<p>Egret has scarcely left the room when the secretary comes dashing after her. “Ma’am!” she cries breathlessly. “No answer from the depot—”</p>
<p>Egret rounds on her. “What do you mean, <em>no answer from the depot?”</em></p>
<p>The secretary shrinks back. “Just that! Operator says there’s still current, the line hasn’t been cut… they’re just not saying anything.”</p>
<p>“Then <em>keep to trying!</em> Find me as soon as you get a reply or the wires cut out. And, God, try and get word to Silent Falls, will you. This is getting out of control.”</p>
<p>“V-very good, ma’am!”</p>
<p>The first thing Egret sees through the window when she makes it back to her office is a soldier crumpling on the ground below, blood spurting from her head. The rebels are arming themselves from the fallen, she realizes. She slams the doors to the balcony, bolting them tightly.</p>
<p>“Intendant!”</p>
<p>Egret turns quickly. The Captain of the Guard is clutching another guard for support, one leg hanging unused. Her face is bruised and cut.</p>
<p>“What in ash <em>happened!?”</em></p>
<p>“It’s happening all over, m-ma’am. All over the camp,” Owl rasps. “We lost three trying to break through to the barracks—”</p>
<p>The other soldier waves a sheaf of papers at Egret. “Up from the telegraph office, ma’am. Only a couple buildings are reporting in—”</p>
<p>Egret snatches the papers. “Scribe!” she bellows, flicking through the pages, hoping in vain for a recognizable symbol.</p>
<p>A small, mousey woman in blue-white robes peeks her head around the door. “Y-yes, ma’am?” she stammers.</p>
<p>Egret thrusts the papers at her. “Read! Now!”</p>
<p>The scribe takes the papers gingerly. “Ah… ‘armory to base…on lockdown…prisoners attempting to break through…t-twelve guards…down…’” She pales as the meaning of the words hits her. “Um. ‘Workhouse three to base. Fighting room to r-room…hostages t-taken…three overseers dead at least. Req-questing backup—’”</p>
<p>“‘It’s bad, it’s bad, it’s bad,’” Egret interrupts mockingly. “That’s all you have to tell me?” She smacks the scribe alongside the cheek with a mailed hand; the girl stumbles and cries out in pain. “Some help you are. Shoo! Out!” She turns to Owl. “Give me a <em>strategy,</em> Captain!”</p>
<p>“We…” Owl hesitates. “We’re… overwhelmed and outnumbered, ma’am. We need to fall back.” She grimaces in pain, wiping dirt from her face. “They can’t sustain this, no way in Haven. The food’s secured. We wait them out, until they either starve or surrender.”</p>
<p>The intendant pales. “That… we can’t beat ’em?”</p>
<p>“Not by force of arms. There’s less’n a hundred of us now. Be a battallion’s work subduing them all.”</p>
<p>“So it’s a siege, then.” Egret sinks back into her chair, and clasps her head in her hands. “For… a week, maybe two if they’re real desperate. I’m already behind quota, I am. The General will have my hide!”</p>
<p>“So will the prisoners, ma’am,” mutters the Captain.</p>
<p>Egret slams her fist down, denting the wooden desk. The room is silent for a moment, the only sounds the distant desperate scrabble of battle, as the intendant fixes her eyes on a candle and takes several slow, deep breaths.</p>
<p>Then she crumples, muscles slackening, the fight going out of her.</p>
<p>“What’s a woman to do,” she mumbles.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The sounds of combat have begun to die away when Otter returns to the bunks, a soldier close on his heels. Savren lets out a sigh of relief. “You’re alive.”</p>
<p>“Savi!” Vasuen rushes up to her, touches her on the cheek. “Oh… oh, skies… Otter told me it was bad, but…”</p>
<p><em>“Hal iene, tirlas?”</em> Savren demands sharply.</p>
<p>Vasuen instantly steps back and salutes. “Area secured, ma’am. Enemy forces have retreated to fortified positions but they’re contained. Friendly casualties were… substantial but there have only been a few fatalities.”</p>
<p>Savren exhales raggedly, leaning back against the wall. “At ease, then, Vassi.”</p>
<p>“Does this mean I can tend to you now?”</p>
<p>“Only if you keep filling me in.”</p>
<p>“I can multitask,” Vasuen responds briskly, dropping to her knees and setting a dirty, battered metal case on the cot. “Rosies didn’t have much in the way of medical supplies, but there’s bandages and alcohol. And, uh. Leeches.”</p>
<p>Savren winces. “Let’s forego the leeches.”</p>
<p>“If you insist! Off with that tunic; show me your back.”</p>
<p>Savren dutifully obeys, gripping the metal frame of the cot as she lays face down. Vasuen can’t restrain a gasp as the extent of the damage becomes clear.</p>
<p>“You’re <em>still bleeding—</em> stars; Otter, find me a towel or… a cloth… <em>something sanitary!</em> Oh, Savi, you poor thing. When I get my hands on that intendant—”</p>
<p>She strokes Savren’s neck gently as she works, mopping up blood and swabbing the cuts clean. Savren twitches and shudders at the sting of the alcohol, letting out faint gasps and cries of pain. Otter sits cross-legged on the floor by her, taking her hands in his, squeezing them tightly. Savren flashes him a weak, grateful smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, sit up. I need to bandage you. This is going to be tricky.” Vasuen carefully lifts Savren to a sitting position, motioning for Otter to help. “Keep her upright. I can’t have her leaning on the wall.”</p>
<p>Otter nods quickly and sits behind Savren, taking her by the shoulders. “Is this okay? Is this enough support?”</p>
<p>“You’re doing fine, <em>surin,”</em> Savren murmurs. Her vision is starting to go fuzzy again; she can feel her limbs tingling.</p>
<p>Otter blushes. “I… thank you, <em>surin.”</em></p>
<p>“Just… sorry I didn’t have the chance… to fight beside you…”</p>
<p>Otter squeezes her shoulders. “Hey, there’s still plenty of time for that.”</p>
<p>The two of them wrap bandage after bandage around Savren’s waist, sealing away the open wounds. Very carefully, Vasuen slips the tunic back over Savren’s head, tugging it down to her thighs.</p>
<p>“How are you doing? Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>Savren nods, slowly standing, muscles in her face still twitching involuntarily from the pain. “It’ll have to do.”</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re—”</p>
<p>“The people need a leader.”</p>
<p>The crowd parts as Savren exits the bunks. A lot of these people know her by name. Almost all of them know her by reputation or rumor. A chant goes up as she plods determinedly toward a captured workhouse, climbing the stairs to the balcony. A hundred, a thousand women and men are chanting her name. She grips the railing tightly, and holds up a hand.</p>
<p>As one, the crowd falls silent.</p>
<p>“Comrades!” she calls out, voice still quavering, raising a fist, gazing out across the crowd. It spread out like a ripple, hands held skyward, arms pumping in jubilation. “I wish I was a speechmaker. I wish I knew your tongue better. Because what you have done here today, I can’t say the words it deserves. I’m just a soldier.</p>
<p>“But a soldier knows victory when she sees it. She knows strength when she sees it. And she knows a comrade when she sees her. And you — each and every one you, who answered the call of revolution, the call to take a stand against slavery and violation; who put your lives on the line in the name of your sisters and brothers in chains — you are comrades.” She reaches up, tries to wipe her eyes dry. “The whispers you’ve heard are true. Those lights in the sky mean rescue is on its way.”</p>
<p>Tears are streaming down her cheek now. She feels giddy, faint. She leans into the railing for support. “The Allies are coming,” she calls out. “My people are coming.”</p>
<p>As the cheer goes up, Savren looks down at her feet, taking a few deep, shuddering breaths. The world feels unreal. Dreamlike. Like any moment she’ll wake up back on that dingy cot to the sound of the morning bells.</p>
<p>But this is real.</p>
<p>This is <em>real.</em></p>
<p><em>Tomorrow, I’m going to wake up in my uniform.</em></p>
<p><em>Tomorrow, I’m going to hold a rifle again.</em></p>
<p>“You have already done so much,” Savren calls out as the crowd begins to quiet down. “We have all suffered so much. All that’s left to do is wait. Keep the <em>den tsuang</em> pinned in their kennels. Soon, we’ll be free.” She glances around the crowd. “Soon,” she adds, lowering her voice, “we will have justice for the indignities visited upon us.”</p>
<p>A roar of approval from the crowd. Savren holds up a hand. “We have accomplished something truly great today. In the words of my people: sav valari citte!”</p>
<p>Some of them try to pronounce it. Savren can’t help but smile at how the Rosies and Khmai all enthusiastically butcher it. She descends the stairs, meeting Vasuen and Otter at the bottom. The other prisoners of war quickly move to join them, standing in a small circle around Savren.</p>
<p>Savren looks to each in turn. “I’m so proud of you all for making it this far,” she murmurs. “You are the strongest women and men I’ve ever known. You’ve fought soldiers and sickness and torture and… so much trauma. And you survived. You survived to make it to this day. I am so privileged to have such brave hearts to lead.”</p>
<p>Sarshal salutes crisply. “First thing I do when I get back is put in a formal request to transfer to your unit, ma’am. Not like there’s much left of mine, anyway.”</p>
<p>Listar nods, saluting as well. “I couldn’t have asked for a better commander to carry us through, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Damn right.” Tenuan salutes too. For a moment, he’s his old self again. Fire in his eyes, not fear. His hands aren’t even shaking. His gaze is steady.</p>
<p>One by one, they all salute her. Savren returns the salute, not even trying to hide the tears welling up again in her eyes. “I need each of you to form a unit,” she tells them, lowering her hand. “Lisi, find the power feeds to every building under enemy control that you can and see that they’re cut. Starting with that bunker. Communication lines too, if these barbarians have any. Sar, round up what rations you can, see that they’re distributed as equally as possible. Ten, secure the railway. I don’t want any surprises when the Allies roll in.” She turns to the others. “The rest of you, I want you to put together patrols. Pick up any of the wounded that we’ve missed. Collect all the weapons you can. And kill any den tsuang still breathing.”</p>
<p>She turns to Vasuen. “And Vasi, you and Otter with me.”</p>
<p>Otter inclines his head. “Always, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Vasuen snorts. “Like I’d go anywhere else.”</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>“Is the fighting done?”</p>
<p>Egret’s hunched at her desk, idly toying with a small jewelled trinket. The captain, clinging to a support column and peering out the window, nods slowly.</p>
<p>“Shit, I see someone. They’re all moving to make way for her.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got themselves a <em>leader?”</em> Egret growls. “How’d this happen, then, Owl? Right under our noses! A… camp full of murderers, thieves, smugglers, whores, junkies, highway bandits, pirates, heretics, and Greens set themselves up a <em>goddamn insurrection</em> and we never even saw it. How did this <em>happen?”</em></p>
<p>“Don’t matter now, do it?” returns Owl levelly. “Leader or no leader they’ll starve just the same.”</p>
<p>Egret scowls. “So’ll we, if the depot don’t start to talking again soon. A touch worried for that, I am.”</p>
<p>Owl shrugs. “What’s the worst could have happened? It’s that useless bloody telegraph, mark my words.”</p>
<p>“Here’s to hoping.”</p>
<p>Owl suddenly lets out an oath. “It’s <em>her!”</em></p>
<p>“What? Who?”</p>
<p>“Their leader! It’s that Green bitch from earlier.”</p>
<p>“…the one you whipped ’til she couldn’t walk?”</p>
<p>“That’s the one.”</p>
<p>Egret scowls. “Unbelievable.” She stands up suddenly, walks to the balcony doors, wrenches them open. “It’s time to put me an end to this nonsense.”</p>
<p>A bullet pings off her armor almost immediately as she steps outside. She flings her hands protectively in front of her face. <em>“Parley!”</em> she shouts. “Parley, you barbarians! I only want to talk!”</p>
<p>The Green girl turns, clasping her hands behind her back, and gazes levelly up at Egret. “Intendant Egret Sunshield,” she calls up, her tone faintly mocking, “by my authority under the Treaty of Mill Creek as an officer of an Allied Power to enforce the martial law of the Provisional Government of the Northern Territories, the Free Khmai State, the People’s Republic of Westcastle, the West Plains Protectorate, and the Society of Worlds…”</p>
<p>She pauses, smirking, savoring the words. “I name you subject to the jurisdiction of the Society of Worlds and place you under arrest pursuant to the Uniform Collectivization Code, the Uniform Code on Crimes of War, and the Society Theatre Charter on Enemy Combatants and Prisoners of War. You will surrender your arms and person and desist from any further resistance or you will be liable to summary execution.”</p>
<p>Egret blinks. <em>“‘The Treaty of Mill Creek…’</em> Good God, are you for <em>real?</em> Grow <em>up,</em> girl! There’s no escape for any of you. You’ll never reach your precious Allies.” Her breathing is ragged, eyes wild. “The rail is the <em>only</em> way in or out!” she screams down at Savren. “And there will come no more trains ’til my say-so. Now I’m going to give you one chance to surrender and get back to work, or we’ll leave you to starve in the snow!”</p>
<p>For the first time in months, Savren Shalsheni laughs. She turns and walks towards the rail depot.</p>
<p>“Ma’am…” Owl calls to Egret from the safety of the office. “You’re needed.”</p>
<p>Egret gives Savren one last frustrated scowl and walks back inside, slamming the doors after her. “What is it <em>now?”</em></p>
<p>“Word from the lookout tower.” Owl fidgets nervously. “Someone saw a train coming.”</p>
<p>Egret blinks twice.</p>
<p><em>“What?”</em></p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The dilapidated train cuts its engines as it nears the platform, one last gasp of steam belching from the locomotive. Savren raises a hand in greeting as it starts to slow, brakes grinding and screeching.</p>
<p>Her heart is pounding as it comes to a halt. There’s a little voice at the back of her head, screaming that it can’t be real. That the doors are going to open and Imperial Guard are going to swarm out and throw her on the ground again and take off her clothes and—</p>
<p>She digs her dirty fingernails into her thigh again, trying to distract herself from the memory. Then the first passenger car’s door hisses open.</p>
<p>And Savren lets out a gasp of relief.</p>
<p>“Sil a iur, comrades!” An officer in dress blacks steps out of the train, a commander’s beads in his hair and a special forces band on his arm. He’s followed quickly by two soldiers in hardsuits and carrying rifles. He raises a hand.</p>
<p>Savren runs toward him, and throws her arms tight around him.</p>
<p>He only seems surprised for a moment, quickly returning the embrace. Savren begins to shake, then to cry, great, heaving sobs of relief. She feels dizzy. His arms are right on top of the whip wounds and it hurts something horrible and she still doesn’t want him to let go.</p>
<p>After a long moment, she reluctantly pulls away, smiles up at him. “Sorry. S-sorry. I just—”</p>
<p>“You have nothing to apologize for, comrade,” the officer says warmly, clapping her on the shoulder. “Commander Nishvir Mirlisi Niluani of the Mirlisi Fifth and mission commander for Joint Task Force Black Horizon, at your service.”</p>
<p>“C-commander Savren Sh-shalsheni Hasciti,” Savren returns weakly, putting a hand on his shoulder in turn. “Of the… labor camp irregulars. And what’s left of the Shalsheni Second.”</p>
<p>Nishvir nods briskly. “I’m honored to meet you, comrade.”</p>
<p>“And I you. Sil a iur.”</p>
<p>The commander nods at his guard, who issues an order into her radio. The rest of the coach doors begin to open, infantry and techs spilling out. Two engineers immediately set to work emplacing field guns on the platform. Crates of cargo are swiftly unloaded, all labeled in the familiar blocky script of home. Black-armored Society troops working hand in hand with a train full of Free Khmai and local resistants. Every race, every uniform on the planet represented. Their precision is unerring.</p>
<p>“Ac vittash, san.” One of the soldiers indicates Otter, glancing at Nishvir and readying his rifle.</p>
<p>Otter pales. Savren quickly steps between them. “He’s a comrade. I vouch for him.”</p>
<p>“At ease, soldier.” Nishvir waves her away. “He’s one of us.”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>
<p>Savren looks back at Nishvir. “It’s… I’ve never been so glad to see a special forces deployment.”</p>
<p>“…you look like you still need a hug.”</p>
<p>Savren immediately flushes. “I… am going to need a lot of hugs. Uh. My… my back, though—”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with it?”</p>
<p>“Wounded. Kind of all over. It’s not—”</p>
<p>“She needs medical attention,” Vasuen interrupts, glaring at Savren. “Real medical attention, not alcohol and leeches.”</p>
<p>“Vasi, you already fixed me up, I’m—”</p>
<p>“You need stitches. And real antibiotics. I don’t think those bandages were very clean.”</p>
<p>“…leeches?” asks Nishvir, blinking.</p>
<p>“Are you going to stand down voluntarily or do I have to ask Nishvir-roshlas to relieve you?”</p>
<p>Savren hesitates, then inclines her head. “As you wish. I commit my unit to the JTF and relinquish command to Vasuen Shalsheni. I stand down.”</p>
<p>Vasuen gives a sigh of relief. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“We have a coach set up for triage until we’ve secured the area,” says Nishvir. “After everything you’ve been through, I’d like to see you ride this out somewhere secure.”</p>
<p>Savren glances at Vasuen. “Otter, you stick with her? Keep an eye out for my second in command?”</p>
<p>“Of course, comrade!”</p>
<p>“You two are just about all I have left.”</p>
<p>Vasuen wraps her arms around Savren’s neck, and holds her tightly for a moment. “I’ll be fine, Savi. Worry about yourself for once,” she says, withdrawing.</p>
<p>“Is that an order?”</p>
<p>“I’m acting commander of the Second now, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>Savren salutes lazily. “Then yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>A small smile flits across Vasuen’s face before she turns and follows the rest of the troops down from the platform.</p>
<p>Nishvir extends a hand. “Allow me?”</p>
<p>Savren inclines her head and takes his hand. “Please.”</p>
<p>Two armored soldiers take hold of her and help lift her into the train as she puts her feet on the steps. There’s no telling how old the train is; from the scuffs and rust and mismatched parts it might well predate the Empire. But it’s warmly lit and filled with luxuriously cushioned seats. It’s a friendly, welcoming sort of dilapidated.</p>
<p>Nishvir leads her past bustling activity and cars full of cargo. Citizens salute them both as they pass. Savren closes her eyes, drinking in the beautiful sound of her native tongue all around her.</p>
<p>“How long were you held there, comrade?” Nishvir asks gently. Savren hesitates.</p>
<p>“What’s the date?”</p>
<p>“Nine-one-eight slash three-three-eight.”</p>
<p>“Nine-o… stars and skies.”</p>
<p>“Comrade?”</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s been a year. A year and a season.”</p>
<p>Nishvir squeezes her hand. “Novas above… I am so sorry.”</p>
<p>Savren silently clutches his wrist with her free hand.</p>
<p>The last train car’s had its seats stripped out to make room for stretchers and surgical supplies. A surgeon leaps to her feet as Nishvir enters the room.</p>
<p>“Commander! What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“We have a wounded comrade who needs her back stitched up.” Nishvir steps aside and motions to Savren. “This is Savren Shalsheni of the Second. You have her file?”</p>
<p>The surgeon taps a few keys on a terminal, then nods. “Right here. Marked MIA. Comrade, if you would take a seat here?”</p>
<p>Savren sits gingerly on the surgical table. “Take good care of her,” Nishvir instructs. “She’s the woman who liberated the camp.” He bows. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a battle to lead.”</p>
<p>“Thank you again, Nishvir.”</p>
<p>“Please. Call me Nisha.”</p>
<p>As Nishvir leaves the room, the surgeon busies herself undressing Savren. “Can you tell me a little bit about your complaints? Are you in any pain?”</p>
<p>“I’m… in a lot. They… whipped me.”</p>
<p>“They <em>whipped</em> you?” The surgeon’s voice is a mix of horror and fury. “That’s… what kind of fucking <em>barbarian</em>… Wait there, I’m going to get you a shot of fentadone.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Oh, um, I didn’t catch your name?”</p>
<p>“Mirian, dear. Hold your arm out for me?”</p>
<p>The familiar feel of the cold metal biting into her vein is like hearing an old friend’s voice for the first time in years. Moments later, a surge of warmth and relief washes through her, the pain from her back melting away. Savren gives a little gasp, takes a few deep breaths, her eyelids fluttering from the rush.</p>
<p>“…s-sun and moon but that feels better.” She leans forward, resting her head in her hands. “Stars above. Thank you. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>“After what you’ve been through, dear, you can have all the fent you want.”</p>
<p>Savren sits there silently for a few moments as Mirian slices through her bandages, awash in the overwhelming euphoria of the drug. She catches a glimpse of the surgeon distastefully holding the scraps of bloodsoaked fabric between thumb and forefinger before discarding them in a biohazard bin.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a lot of bad things in my job but…” Mirian’s voice is shaking. “This isn’t the worst injury, but it’s the worst <em>thing</em> I’ve ever seen. Stars, just… looking at this makes me want to give you another shot. Imagine doing this to another human being.”</p>
<p>“They did worse things to us.”</p>
<p>“…you poor girl.”</p>
<p>Savren can dimly feel the antibiotic gel seeping into her wounds, but there’s no pain, just a weird, unsettling sensation. “The good news,” Mirian comments, “is that the wound profile isn’t wide enough to need stitches. Medibond and some nice tight bandages should do the job.”</p>
<p>“Thank fuck.”</p>
<p>“Lay down on your stomach for me, will you? Have you ever cared for a gelled wound before?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Too many times.”</p>
<p>“Good. Well, not <em>good</em> — you know what I mean.” Mirian pats her arm. “Hold still. This won’t hurt but it’s still going to suck.”</p>
<p>Savren closes her eyes, tries to ignore the strange tingling, violating sensations from her back as the surgeon dresses the wounds. She can still feel air passing through the lacerations, feel it with nerves that were never supposed to feel fresh air. But with every wound gelled and bandaged the feeling subsides a bit more.</p>
<p>“There. All done. You can rest there as long as you like, dear. Well. Until we have another casualty to treat, at least.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, I… I’d rather be on my feet.”</p>
<p>“Why are you active-duties <em>always</em> like this? It’s called <em>medical advice,</em> not <em>medical disinformation.”</em></p>
<p>“I should have been fighting in that battle. It all happened without me. I owe them.”</p>
<p>“Can you please repress the survivor’s guilt a bit until it’s not going to make my job harder? Turn your head, I need to scan your chip.” Mirian presses a reader plate to Savren’s neck and glances at the computer screen. “Good, good, you are who you say you are. Telling Tel Casran an MIA is alive and kicking is my favorite part of this posting, you know.”</p>
<p>With weak arms, Savren pulls herself into a sitting position. “Vasuen Shalsheni, Tenuan Shalsheni, Listar Hecueni, Sarshal Uansari. They’re all alive too. So’s—”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear it but there are <em>procedures,</em> dear.” Mirian pats her on the shoulder. “You wouldn’t credit some of the underhanded tricks the Rosies have played trying to smuggle spies into our midst.” She smirks. “Not that it ever works.”</p>
<p>Savren looks down at her naked chest, her emaciated stomach. Bruises and cuts. The edges of bandages peeking around from her back. She grits her teeth.</p>
<p>“Can I have my tunic back?”</p>
<p>“It’s not regulation. It’s also covered in blood and who knows what other biohazards, so I had to dispose of it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want people to see me like this.”</p>
<p>“About that!” Nishvir leans into the room, holding a bundle of black fabric. “I know it’s not tailored, but—”</p>
<p>Tears well up in Savren’s eyes. She walks unsteadily to the door and takes the fabric, letting it unfold in front of her.</p>
<p>Five loops of black flex-fiber with a white hem.</p>
<p>“N…Nisha…”</p>
<p>“I brought a sash and some wraps, too. They should be about the right size.”</p>
<p>Savren clutches the uniform to her chest. Her frail body is suddenly wracked with sobs.</p>
<p>“Here.” Nishvir pats a stretcher. “Sit down. I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have a battle to lead, sir?” Mirian interjects, glaring.</p>
<p>“It turns out Comrade Savren here did all the work for me,” Nishvir replies breezily. “The whole area’s secure. We have a few <i>pien şai</i> in bolt-holes to smoke out, but they’re contained, so until the engineers have a breach plan together, we’re all just sitting on our hands. Have I mentioned I hate going in without advance intel?” He sighs. “If these idiots kept <em>blueprints</em> anywhere, like <em>civilized</em> people, we’d have the whole facility under control and we’d be marching the Rosies out in shackles already.”</p>
<p>“Now that would be a sight for sore eyes,” comments Mirian. “You should have seen her wounds, sir. They <em>whipped</em> her.”</p>
<p>Nishvir actually flinches. “I’ve seen that kind of wound before. How long did it have to fester?”</p>
<p>“Just happened a few hours ago, fortunately. I don’t want to think what her back would have looked like after a few days without treatment.”</p>
<p>“Stars, you poor girl—”</p>
<p><i>“Tilit elen tare,”</i> Savren blurts out, staring up at Nishvir.</p>
<p>Nishvir smiles down at her. “Now what’s that about?”</p>
<p>“I— sorry, I just…” Savren shakes her head. “All of a sudden everyone’s taking care of me and being kind to me and—”</p>
<p><i>“Tamit val tare.</i> You’ve been strong long enough.” Nishvir ruffles her hair and Savren immediately blushes. “What kind of comrades would we be if we didn’t look after you?”</p>
<p>Mirian stares at Savren. “How long was she in that camp, do you know, sir?”</p>
<p>“Over a year.”</p>
<p>“Over a—” Mirian grits her teeth. “Over a <em>year</em> away from the People, away from any support, fending for herself and being tortured?”</p>
<p>Nishvir nods silently.</p>
<p>“Where’s the nearest counselor?”</p>
<p>“The Territorial Capital. We’ll get her there soon enough, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Can’t happen too soon. I honestly think she’s going to need a <i>vartash</i> to take care of her for a while.”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll have to be her <i>varinar</i> until a counselor can make that call, won’t we?”</p>
<p>Mirian purses her lips, and turns back to Savren. “You said there were other citizens here, <i>Savren-roshlas?”</i></p>
<p>“One of the others met us at the depot,” Nishvir interjects.</p>
<p>Savren nods. “That was Vasuen. My second-in-command. But there’s more besides me and her.”</p>
<p>“How long have they all been here?”</p>
<p>“Some got here after me. Some got here before. Vasuen and Tenuan got here with me. I don’t really know how long. They didn’t exactly give us calendars.”</p>
<p>Mirian pales. “Do you think one counselor is going to be enough, sir?”</p>
<p>“There’s more than one in the Territories, Miri.”</p>
<p>Mirian nods distractedly. “Okay. Good. Stars but this is going to be a long, hard clean-up.”</p>
<p>“Did you bring many medics?” Savren asks quietly.</p>
<p>“A coach full of them. And another surgeon. They’re out treating the wounded. Don’t worry, we’re not neglecting people in favor of you.”</p>
<p>Savren breathes out. “Okay. Thank you. That’s a relief.”</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Egret watches, paralyzed, as black-armored troops march through the compound. Armor. Rifles. Professional fucking soldiers.</p>
<p><em>This can’t be happening. We’re nowhere near the front. How did they get this far behind our lines?</em> Why <em>did they come all this way?</em></p>
<p>“Ma’am? Ma’am, what do we do?”</p>
<p>Owl’s voice jerks Egret out of her fugue. “Can… can we get through to the General?” she murmurs hoarsely.</p>
<p>“They’ve cut the cables, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Egret sinks into her couch, seizing a decanter of wine with one hand. “Do we <em>got</em> any options ’sides fighting to the death?”</p>
<p>Owl hesitates. “We… could surrender?”</p>
<p>The lid of the decanter clunks against her helmet.</p>
<p>“…sorry, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“I’ll <em>die</em> before I surrender to a band of inbred hoodlums and their heretic sidekicks!” Egret screeches. She takes a swig of wine straight from the decanter. “I can’t think of one worse way to dishonor our Empress. Not a one!”</p>
<p>Owl looks down. She unholsters her sidearm.</p>
<p>“Then… I guess…”</p>
<p>An explosion shatters every window in the bunker. The rattle of automatic gunfire fills the air. Owl hobbles to the door.</p>
<p>“What in ash—” cries Egret, leaping to her feet.</p>
<p>“They blew the doors!” Owl shouts back. “With me, behind cover!”</p>
<p>Then there’s a rattle. A clink. Egret looks down. She frowns at the little cylinder rolling across the floor.</p>
<p>Then everything goes white.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>“Bunker is secure. Repeat, bunker is secure. Minimal casualties, no friendlies down. Please advise disposition of prisoners. Over.”</p>
<p>The five of them crowded into the makeshift situation car exhale in unison. Vasuen puts an arm around Savren’s shoulder as Nishvir picks up the mic.</p>
<p>“Good work, everyone. Hold position under further notice. Command out.”</p>
<p>“Wilco. Breach team one out.”</p>
<p>“It never gets any easier, does it,” Savren murmurs.</p>
<p>Nishvir shakes his head. “It’s gut-wrenching every time. Sometimes I really wish they’d lead with ‘no friendly casualties.’”</p>
<p>“This is why she hates being away from the action,” Vasuen interjected.</p>
<p>“I feel helpless giving orders from a fucking APC.”</p>
<p>“So do I sometimes.” Nishvir hooks the handset back onto his robe and rubs his forehead.</p>
<p>Savren runs a hand up and down the soft, sleek fabric of her uniform again, staring down at the black folds, eyes tracing the outline of the symbol on her armbands. She touches the green beads in her hair. Reassuring herself they’re all really there. That it’s all really real.</p>
<p>“I should head over there.”</p>
<p>“You should what?”</p>
<p>Savren clears her throat. “I need to get to the bunker. I can identify a lot of the prisoners. Who’s a risk, who’s not. Who we might be able to ransom. The people should see me there, too.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you stand down?” Nishvir asks.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking to be reinstated. That wouldn’t be good for the chain of command anyway. I’m asking to serve under you, temporarily.”</p>
<p>Nishvir glances at Vasuen, then turns on his handset. “Put through to Mirian.”</p>
<p><em>“Yes, sir.”</em></p>
<p>“Miri, is there any immediate physical risk to Savren-<em>roshlas’</em> health if she walks around outside for a bit?”</p>
<p><em>“The only risk that comes to mind is rapid lead impaction,”</em> the surgeon admits grudgingly. <em>“But she’s not remotely combat-ready.”</em></p>
<p>“Acknowledged. Nishvir out.” The commander turns back to Savren, and hands her a handset. “You’ll get a sidearm and two bodyguards to accompany you. You will serve in an advisory role and withdraw immediately if any risk to your safety arises. You’ll keep me apprised of your movements. Does that sound reasonable to you?”</p>
<p>Savren nods, turning the handset over and over in her hands, clutching it tightly. “It does. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re right that we need you out there. The prisoners here trust you. Maybe make some speeches before you head back?”</p>
<p>Savren makes a face. “I’m no good at those— uh, sir.”</p>
<p>“I was hoping one of us would be. Ah, well.” Nishvir issues an order into his handset. “Your guards will be waiting for you outside.”</p>
<p>Two armored soldiers step up to Savren as she clambers down from the coach. They salute.</p>
<p>“Commander Savren!”</p>
<p>“That’s me. You are?”</p>
<p>“Lismir, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Rashten, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “With me, then. Otter!”</p>
<p>The boy looks up from where he’s sitting on the edge of the platform next to a field gun. His eyes widen.</p>
<p>“Oh, wow! Savi!” He jumps to his feet. She beckons, and he runs to her, hugging her gently. “You look so good. Wow, I never thought I’d actually get to see you in uniform.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, me neither.” Savren fingers her beads again. “It still doesn’t feel real. I keep thinking any minute I’m going to wake up alone on that horrible fucking cot—”</p>
<p>“It’s real, alright,” says Otter firmly. “It’s the realest thing I’ve ever seen. You’re awake, Savi. You really are.”</p>
<p>Savren smiles at him. “We’re heading back to the bunker. They’ve taken it. Everyone inside’s been killed or captured. Do you want to come with?”</p>
<p>“Y-you’ll take me?” Otter’s face lit up. “I thought — I thought with the Allies here you’d be… well. I didn’t think you’d have any more time for me.”</p>
<p>“I will always have time for you, Otter. Come on.” Savren extends a hand. “We need to go gloat at the intendant.”</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Egret sits numbly against a wall. Her armor is bunching up and poking her in uncomfortable places. Her ears are still ringing, but her vision’s slowly coming back, enough to see Greens and Khmai rabble ransacking her office. And the girl handcuffed next to her, bawling her eyes out.</p>
<p>“Have some dignity, woman,” she rasps at the scribe. “What sort of servant of the Empress are you, mewling and burbling like a <i>pien şai</em> in a—”</p>
<p>“Quiet!” orders a soldier. Egret sneers.</p>
<p>“Or what? You’re going to kill us all anyway.”</p>
<p>The next thing she knows, she’s been hauled to her feet, and  with inhuman strength and speed, thrown against a table. She screams as pain floods her nerves, something hot and sharp pressed to the nape of her neck; she thrashes wildly, trying to no avail to break free of the soldier’s iron grip.</p>
<p>“Why would we kill you, Intendant?” says a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>The soldier pulls the sparker away from Egret’s neck and hauls her to her feet, turning her to face…</p>
<p>The girl from before. Egret almost doesn’t recognize her. Gone are the tattered tunic and breeches of a camp prisoner. She’s dressed in a sleek black uniform. Standing tall for her small size. Eyes full of new steel. The symbol of the Greens on her arm. Egret pales.</p>
<p><em>What’s-her-name.</em></p>
<p><em>She’s in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>She’s going to…</em></p>
<p><em>…oh God.</em></p>
<p>Savren flicks her fingers and the soldier immediately pushes Egret to her knees. She presses a switch on her radio. <i>“Ac Savren solat. Uasvinana evessho se.</i> Egret Sunshield. <i>A uassheva ari.</i> Owl<i>-gansul. Vade.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Ac sol Savrenat; coshe, Savren. Esasshe.”</i></p>
<p>Savren glances around the office. “You’ve been living large, haven’t you, Intendant? Wine, a fireplace, a nice warm bed.” She takes a seat on Egret’s desk, clasping her hands in her lap as she stares down at the shaking officer. “While all your slaves are starving and freezing in cramped cots and dying in the mine. I’ll bet you even have your own cook, don’t you?”</p>
<p><em>This can’t be happening. God, this can’t be happening. I want to wake up.</em></p>
<p>“You won’t win,” Owl spits, trying to stand up despite her broken leg. “The Empress—”</p>
<p>Lismir immediately slams her against the wall.</p>
<p>“Your bravado is cute but really, spare me.” Savren hops down and walks over to the captain. “The camp is secure. All remaining resistance has been crushed. By the time anyone comes to your rescue, we’ll all be deep in Allied territory.”</p>
<p>“This is the captain?” Lismir interjects.</p>
<p>“Mm-hm.”</p>
<p>“The one who did that to your back?” Otter growls.</p>
<p>“Mm-hm.” Savren turns around, back to Egret. “Do you know what I’m going to do to you, Lady Sunshield?”</p>
<p>Egret can’t meet her eyes. Savren can hear her teeth chattering.</p>
<p>“After everything you did to me, Lady Sunshield?”</p>
<p>“…please. Please don’t.”</p>
<p>Savren laughs. “I’m not going to do <em>anything<em> to you, Lady Sunshield! In fact, I’m going to make absolutely sure you make it safely out of this camp. That you live a nice long life.” She pats Egret on the head. “Because when my people have finished… <em>debriefing</em> you, you’re going to spend the rest of your pathetic bourgeois existence repaying the debts you’ve accrued to the working class of this world. You and every other <em>den tsuang</em> parasite who’s unlucky enough to survive the War. You will never taste free air again. You will never know comfort again.” She kneels down, looking Egret in the eye. “You will never hurt anyone again.”</p>
<p>Egret whimpers.</p>
<p>There’s a commotion by the door. Savren turns just in time to see a young woman in a blue and white robe, bruised and cuffed, make a run for the exit. Rashten moves to intercept her but the girl trips on her own feet and tumbles, toppling to the floor, unable to catch herself with her hands behind her back. She’s surrounded instantly, rifles aimed at her head. “Don’t move,” Rashten commands. “Or you will be fired upon.”</p>
<p>The girl begins to sob.</p>
<p>“Stand down!” Savren quickly gets to her feet and motions the troops back. “I don’t think she’s any threat.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, they lower their weapons. Savren kneels down, helps the girl back into a sitting position. She curls up, pulling her legs close and burying her head in them.</p>
<p>Instinctual. Civilian responses.</p>
<p>Harmless.</p>
<p>“Why’s she injured?” Savren demands. “Did she resist?”</p>
<p>A soldier salutes. “No, ma’am. She was injured when we found her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t bother with her.” Egret’s shaking voice finally musters a note of contempt. “Go right ahead and shoot her, the useless bitch. She’s never been good for anything.”</p>
<p>The girl’s shaking so hard now she looks like she’s about to start seizing. Savren reaches out a hand. “It’s okay. Nobody’s going to hurt you, you have my word. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Still shaking, she looks up, timidly, eyes darting this way and that. She opens her mouth but no sound comes out.</p>
<p>Savren touches her gently on the shoulder. She flinches. “What’s your name, girl?”</p>
<p>“…S-Swan, m-mistress.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Swan. I’m Savren. …It’s okay if you can’t pronounce that. Can you tell me what happened to you? How you got hurt?”</p>
<p>“I… I…”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to hurt you. Nobody’s going to hurt you, no matter what you say. Okay? You can tell me.”</p>
<p>“Sh-she… she hit m-me.”</p>
<p>“Who hit you?”</p>
<p>“L-Lady S-S-Sunshield, m-mistress.”</p>
<p>Savren frowns. “And why did she hit you, Swan?”</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know. She was angry. I don’t kn-know what I did wrong…”</p>
<p>“What do you do here, Swan?”</p>
<p>“I’m… I write. And I read. For— for Lady Sunshield.”</p>
<p>“You’re a scribe?”</p>
<p>Swan nods.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna help you stand, okay?” Savren takes her by the arm. Slowly, cautiously, Swan stumbles to her feet. Savren motions to Rashtens. “Her restraints.”</p>
<p>“…are you <em>certain,</em> ma’am?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s harmless.”</p>
<p>Rashten nods and secures her rifle. She takes Swan by the shoulder, slots a chip into her cuffs. They chirp a few times before springing open, and she pulls them off. The girl clutches her wrists, squeezing and massaging them.</p>
<p>Savren indicates the intendant’s desk. “Get some paper and a brush. I want you to write a short sentence for me. Can you do that? It doesn’t matter what it says.”</p>
<p>Swan nods quickly and sits behind the desk. Egret growls at the sight. Savren gives her a mocking smirk.</p>
<p>“I-is this… is this acceptable, m-mistress <i>Sa-vu-len?”</i> Swan holds up a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>Savren examines the sheet. The ideograms are illegible to her, but recognizably the Old Script. She sets it down.</p>
<p>“Tell me something, Swan. If I could promise you a job where you’d be fed well and treated well, just doing the things you already do, would you like that? Somewhere safe and warm?”</p>
<p>Swan stares at her. “W-why would you… I don’t understand…”</p>
<p>Savren takes a seat on the desk, looking down at the little scribe. “You can’t like being here, can you? In a prison camp where you’re beaten for no reason?”</p>
<p>Swan shakes her head.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>“The Guild said I had to.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have to do what the Guild tells you?”</p>
<p>“B-because they trained me. It’s in the contract.” She pales. “If… if I didn’t, they could… they could have me put in the camps too.”</p>
<p>“Do they pay you?”</p>
<p>Swan scowls. “N-not half what I know House Sunshield pays them for me.”</p>
<p>“More than you’re worth!” growls Egret. Listar kicks her, sending her sprawling.</p>
<p>“Quiet!”</p>
<p>Savren ignores the interruption. “How much do you know about the War, Swan?”</p>
<p>“J-just that… they said the Greens were coming, to… to rape us and kill us. Our whole race. So we had to fight.” She frowns. “But… you’re not.”</p>
<p>“No. We’re not. We’re only here to fight the Empress and the nobles. To keep them from hurting more people. And we’re winning.” Savren takes Swan’s hand. “There are free cities where this Guild wouldn’t be able to touch you. You have valuable skills, and I know you’d be welcomed. I could have you sent there.”</p>
<p>“…they wouldn’t beat me?”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“It would be peaceful? I could… I could go to market and to taverns and things again?”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “And you’d be doing important work. You’d be helping make life better for billions of people, in a small way.”</p>
<p>“I…” Swan looks back and forth between Savren and the manacled intendant. “…I will, mistress.”</p>
<p>Savren smiles, and stands up. “Ground ops,” she says into her radio. “Low priority to ops actual.”</p>
<p><em>“Ops actual available. Putting you through now, over.”</em></p>
<p>“Sir, I’ve got a Rosie civvie here who reads and writes the Old Script,” Savren continues. “She wants to defect. I think she could be useful for intel work. Permission to bring her in?”</p>
<p><em>“Granted, Savren. Escort her to refugee processing. Nishvir out.”</em></p>
<p>Savren exhales. The weight of the handset on her uniform is more reassuring than a sidearm with a full mag. The little clicks of the switch, the occasional wide-band operational chatter. More than anything else, it’s making her feel alive again, safe again. Knowing that help, support, power, a friendly voice are one push of a button away… it’s a wonderful feeling, better than a shot of fent. She’s plugged back into the grid again. No more uncertainty. No more being alone.</p>
<p>“So how about that, Egret?” Savren turns back to her. “Your scribe is going to be an important woman. The girl you abused and beat is going to live a life of comfort in the heart of Allied territory. And you’re going to rot in a cell. Maybe you’ll see her again someday, dressed in fine silks and arm-in-arm with the lover of her dreams, walking past the hole you and the rest of the chain gang are digging. I hope you do. And I hope she spits in your face.”</p>
<p>Egret doesn’t look up. A single tear drips down her cheek. Savren turns away.</p>
<p>“Lismir, Rashten, Otter, with me. The rest of you, there are cells downstairs. Secure the prisoners there and await orders.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Swan, come here.” Savren extends a hand. “We’re going to get you out of here, okay?”</p>
<p>Swan nods mutely.</p>
<p>“Good girl.” Switching back to Ranuir, she adds, “Lismir, keep hold of her. I don’t want her bolting if there’s gunfire.”</p>
<p><em>“Coshvin, san.”</em> Lismir takes the girl firmly by the arm. Swan whimpers.</p>
<p>Savren casts one more contemptuous glance around the room as the remaining Imperials are marched out into the hallway. Her gaze catches on the bloody rag in the corner, and she flinches.</p>
<p>“Move out,” she says quietly, turning away.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The word seems to have gotten out, and prisoners are already filtering into processing. The Allies have set up folding desks, right out in the snow, and masses of deep lines have already formed. Infantry is patrolling the site heavily and Savren glimpses a friendly sniper on the balcony of a neighboring workhouse. The sight gives her a little rush.</p>
<p>They wave her through to the front of the line. Next to them, prisoners are being debriefed, the barcode tattoos on their neck scanned, biometrics taken. A field linguist with a laptop beckons them forward.</p>
<p>“How can we help you, comrade?”</p>
<p>Savren leads Swan forward. The girl clasps her hands nervously, looking around wildly. “Defector.”</p>
<p>The linguist smiles at the scribe. “What’s your name, hon?”</p>
<p>“Um. Swan. Swan Wildsun.”</p>
<p>“Get her biometrics, please.” The linguist beckons at a Khmai trooper, who unholsters a reader and begins scanning Swan’s irises and prints. “What was your role in the camp?”</p>
<p>“I… I was just a scribe…”</p>
<p>The linguist glances at Savren, who nods. “Girl was being abused,” she murmurs. “Proletarian. Here against her will. She’s not complicit and we have command clearance to evacuate her.”</p>
<p>“Okay. That makes it simple.” The linguist strikes a few keys and presses a blank card into a printer. There’s a whirr, a clunk, and then she pulls it back out and passes it to Swan. “This is your evacuation ticket. It has your train and car assignments. You’re Priority Two, so you’ll be going out right after the casualties.”</p>
<p>“W-where will they take me?”</p>
<p>“Right now we’re just getting people to emergency housing in the Territories. You’ll be debriefed in a few days and routed on from there. Next!”</p>
<p>Savren leads Swan away from the desk and the line moves forward. “Where do I go now, mistress?” Swan asks, glancing in fear at a patrol.</p>
<p>Savren keys her radio. “Ground ops, do we have a shelter for the defectors in place?”</p>
<p><em>“Confirm. Proceed to northernmost bunks. Ground ops out.”</em></p>
<p>Savren turns to Swan. “We’re going to take you to a bunk. Other defectors are—” She stops and her hand flies to her sidearm as the sound of conflict rises out of the crowd. She turns, steps in front of Swan as her bodyguards ready their rifles.</p>
<p>But it’s already over. The patrol has a Zyahua woman at the front of the queue restrained and is leading her away.</p>
<p>“What just happened?” Savren murmurs.</p>
<p>Lismir says something into her headset. “False colors,” she reports after a moment. “Camp guard tried to pass herself off as a prisoner.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t very smart.” Savren holsters her pistol.</p>
<p>“What will happen to her?” Swan whispers, peering out from behind Savren.</p>
<p>Savren’s features harden. “Same as the rest of the guards.”</p>
<p>Swan looks down, saying nothing.</p>
<p>Defectors are already streaming into the shelter, some led by soldiers, some still restrained. Most of them seem to be in little better shape than the prisoners — gaunt, frightened eyes, more than a few of them wounded. Their dress is richer, but they don’t look much happier.</p>
<p>A soldier stops them at the perimeter. “Has she already been processed, comrade?” he asks Savren.</p>
<p>“Give him your card,” Savren instructs Swan in Zia Ţai. Swan shrinks back.</p>
<p>“He— he—”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem, comrade?” The soldier glances at the shaking girl.</p>
<p>“Swan?”</p>
<p>“He has a gun… men aren’t… men aren’t supposed to… to have guns…”</p>
<p>Savren looks uncertainly at her bodyguards. Otter clears his throat. “It’s an old law, ma’am. Because of the patriarchs…”</p>
<p><em>“I don’t want to be raped!”</em> Swan blurts, trying to hide behind Lismir.</p>
<p>“Otter?” Savren looks at him plaintively.</p>
<p>“Um. Can we… can we to talk to the woman-comrade instead?” Otter asks the soldier in halting Ranuir. The soldier glances in surprise at Savren.</p>
<p>“The Rosie can talk?”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “Can we just do what he says? It’ll probably be simpler that way.”</p>
<p>The soldier gives her a bemused look but inclines his head. He murmurs a request into his headset, and backs away.</p>
<p>Swan looks visibly relieved when a female soldier approaches them. She hands over her card without complaint. The soldier takes it, slots it into a handset, and nods.</p>
<p>“We’ll take her from here, comrade.”</p>
<p>Savren inclines her head. <em>“Lif a til.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Lif a til, surin!”</em></p>
<p>The frightened scribe is ushered away. Savren breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Alright. Let’s—”</p>
<p><em>“All units, all units. Be advised.”</em> She’s interrupted by a wide-band squawk from the radio. <em>“Per new intel enemy reinforcements may be en route. Awaiting satellite confirm. Move to Contingency Two. Repeat, Contingency Two, all units. Ground ops out.”</em></p>
<p>Savren grabs her radio. “Savren to ground ops. Put through to ops actual. Over.”</p>
<p><i>“Wilco, Savren. Hold.”</i></p>
<p>Savren stares at Otter. “What did we miss?”</p>
<p>“Did… did I understand that right? They’re… reinforcements are coming?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know for sure yet—”</p>
<p><i>“Nishvir to Savren, come in, Savren, over.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Roshlas!</i> What in Haven is going on? Over.”</p>
<p><em>“Linguists found telegraph facilities. We have confirmation Rosies got word to Silent Falls, over.”</em></p>
<p><i>“Fuck!”</i> Savren blurts before clutching the key again. “What kind of reinforcements are we expecting? Over.”</p>
<p><em>“Unknown at this time. ORBCOM is still retasking. Your guess is as good as mine.”</em></p>
<p>“How much track have you secured? Rail is the normal means of access, over.”</p>
<p><em>“Very little. Secured a single depot behind lines. Trains are running black. Word gets out, we’re in trouble. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“…how far behind lines are we?”</p>
<p><em>“You don’t want to know, comrade.”</em></p>
<p>Savren’s heart is racing. “May I advise, sir?”</p>
<p><em>“It’s what you’re here for, Savren.”</em></p>
<p>“Decouple the locomotive. Send it out a few klicks in the opposite direction you came from. Dynamite the tracks on the way back. Over.”</p>
<p><em>“Good thinking. We’ll get it done. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“Plans for speeding up the evacuation timeline?”</p>
<p><em>“It was tight already, but we’re working on it. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“I assume forging an all-clear is no-go?”</p>
<p><em>“Confirm. Even if we could decipher their codebooks, the Rosies took precautions, over.”</em></p>
<p>Savren closes her eyes. “Acknowledged. Where do you want me, sir?”</p>
<p><em>“If you’re done with the prisoners, get back to ops. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“Wilco. Savren out.”</p>
<p>Otter stares at her with frightened eyes. “I could barely understand any of that.”</p>
<p>Savren grits her teeth. She can tell the fent is wearing off; the pain is starting to flare up in full. She’s beginning to shake again, to feel nauseous. “Tell you on the way,” she manages. “Back to ops. Let’s move!”</p>
<p>She starts stumbling halfway back, her vision doubling up. Rashten notices immediately and grabs her by the shoulder, trying to steady her. “Ma’am?”</p>
<p>“…hurts…” is all Savren can slur out. The pain is already as bad as bad as when they were whipping her. It’s still getting worse.</p>
<p>“Savi?” Otter touches her arm gently. “Savi, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…I’ll be…fine…”</p>
<p>Rashten touches her headset. “Fireteam two-six incoming; have a medic on standby with analgesics. Over.”</p>
<p>“Wilco, fireteam two-six. Ground ops out.”</p>
<p>They’re carrying her by the time they reach the train. Mirian is waiting for them. She lets out a string of oaths in Ranuir and Khmaira as she fumbles with her kit. “I never cleared her for <em>field duty</em> — hold her arm down, I need a vein!”</p>
<p>Savren’s convulsions slow to a stop as the drug hits her central nervous system. “She does <em>not</em> get off this train again until we reach Point Gale,” Mirian snaps, glaring between Lismir and Rashten. “Haven’s sake, what was she <em>doing?”</em></p>
<p>“Just escorting prisoners,” Otter interjects defensively. “She wasn’t fighting or anything—”</p>
<p>Mirian narrows her eyes. “Where did <em>you</em> learn to talk, Rosie?”</p>
<p>“Taught him,” Savren murmurs.</p>
<p>Mirian stands, motioning to the soldiers. “Get her into the train.” She grips her radio. “Record medical order, Savren Shalsheni is restricted to Green Zone indefinitely. <em>Copy to ops actual.</em>” She glowers at Savren as the Lismir and Rashten lift her to her feet. “Mirian out.”</p>
<p>Nishvir stands up as Savren enters the situation car. He claps her on the shoulder. “Welcome back, comrade. Glad to see you made it safely.”</p>
<p>Vasuen leaps to her feet and hugs Savren impulsively. “Skies above, Savi, don’t — don’t do that to me again. That’s a fucking order.”</p>
<p>“She’ll be riding this one out safe and sound, don’t worry.” Nishvir guides Savren into a seat, then sits back down himself.</p>
<p>“What’s — what’s the situation, sir?” Savren murmurs.</p>
<p>Nishvir gazes at her for a moment. “More importantly, when did you last eat?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me, I’ll—”</p>
<p>“Yesterday at noon,” Vasuen interrupts. “A tiny bowl of some canned slop.”</p>
<p>Nishvir motions to a subordinate. “Get her a couple of MREs.”</p>
<p>“Yessir.”</p>
<p>“The situation,” Nishvir continues, “is we’ve been squeezing the intendant for operational details but she appears to legitimately not know. It seems the Rosies have finally figured out compartmentalization. We’ve sent ahead the locomotive; it’s started laying charges and will reverse course at three hours out.”</p>
<p>“How many switches are there between here and there?”</p>
<p>Nishvir grimaces. “Too many. This isn’t the only camp in the region.”</p>
<p>Savren’s blood runs cold. “How many others?”</p>
<p>“An entire network. This was the only one we could feasibly liberate.”</p>
<p>Savren feels suddenly dizzy. “How many more… more of us…”</p>
<p>“That’s the good news. Drone flyovers picked up no IFFs in the other camps. Not even post-mortem ones. We suspect it’s because this is the biggest. They might not have felt security at the others was tight enough for POWs.”</p>
<p>“That’s something, I suppose. Still—”</p>
<p>“It’s a helpless feeling, isn’t it? Knowing there’s all this cruelty going on around us and that we can’t do anything to stop it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Savren tilts her head slightly. “You’ve done this before.”</p>
<p>“It’s why our JTF was founded.”</p>
<p>Savren looks down. “Sun and moon. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Nishvir takes her by the chin, lifts her head back up. “Don’t be,” he replies, smiling warmly. “It’s brutal, I won’t deny that for a moment. But we haven’t lost a battle yet. And every name we cross off the MIA list… I’d go through a lot worse to bring our people home.”</p>
<p>Savren smiles faintly. “I envy your strength, Nisha.”</p>
<p>Nishvir actually laughs. “And here I was, thinking just the same thing—”</p>
<p>His radio cuts in abruptly. “Commander, incoming call from ORBCOM.”</p>
<p>Instantly the coach falls silent. Savren’s heart starts to race.</p>
<p>“Put them through.”</p>
<p>“Orbit ops to Nishvir Mirlisi.” The microwave feed is rougher, staticky. The words are harder to make out. “Please come in.”</p>
<p>“Orbit ops, Nishvir. Receiving.”</p>
<p>“Nishvir, telemetry confirms enemy mobilization. By rail from three separate garrisons. Disorganized but progressing southeast. Over.”</p>
<p>It feels like the temperature in the coach just dropped ten degrees. Savren fights to restrain the building panic in her chest.</p>
<p>“Deployment size?”</p>
<p>“Estimated at regiment-strength. At least three battallions. Over.”</p>
<p><em>“Fuck,”</em> Savren breathes.</p>
<p>Nishvir’s voice is shaking. “C-confirm, orbit ops. Three battallions?”</p>
<p>“Confirm, sir. Three battallions, over.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the only sound in the coach is the distant hum of the generator.</p>
<p>“The transcript reported a prisoner revolt,” Nishvir says quietly. “Why did they send <em>three battallions?”</em></p>
<p>A linguist pipes up. “They also reported a depot down, sir,” she says. “Rosies may have assumed the worst.”</p>
<p>Nishvir grips his radio, keying back to ops. “Put through to the locomotive!”</p>
<p><em>“Connecting you now, sir.</em></p>
<p>“Taruin, reverse course immediately. Arm the mines as soon as you’re clear of each set. And cut the telegraph wires, while you’re at it.”</p>
<p><em>“Wilco, sir.”</em></p>
<p>He clicks the transmit key twice. “Ops. Reconnect ORBCOM.”</p>
<p><em>“Wilco, sir.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Receiving, Nishvir-</em>roshlas.”</p>
<p>“Can you get me a link for a real-time tac map? Over.”</p>
<p>A pause. Then: <em>“Confirm, sir. Will be live in a few minutes. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“Good man. How far out is the enemy?”</p>
<p><em>“Based on velocity and predicted course… staggered arrivals between five and seven hours, sir. Over.”</em></p>
<p>Nishvir breathes out raggedly. “Acknowledged. Is an orbital strike feasible?”</p>
<p><em>“If we tried to retask an asset, the </em>vittashar<em> would ID it and launch before it could reach range. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“Understood. Nishvir out.”</p>
<p>He releases the radio, looks down, closes his eyes for a long moment. Then he turns in his seat, looks back up at the frozen coach.</p>
<p>“I’m no good at speeches,” he says, quietly but with steel in his voice all the same. “But we can still do this. It’s going to be the hardest damn thing some of us have ever done. But the odds are still in our favor, narrowly. They may have the numbers, but we have the intel, the fortifications… and most importantly, bombs strapped to every rail junction for two hours west. This facility’s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. It’s too far from civilization to reinforce quickly. It was designed to keep people in — they never thought they’d have to keep anyone out. And we’re going to use that against them. Now, I want everyone working on proposals to speed up the operation. We can’t get everyone out before the battle, but I want to make sure we get as many out as possible.”</p>
<p>He glances at Savren, reaches out, takes her hand. She’s trembling, lips moving silently. “No matter what happens,” he says, squeezing her wrist gently. “You’re going home. Okay, Savi? I will move sun and moon to make sure you and yours make it back to the People. I give you my solemn word.”</p>
<p>“I’m…” Savren flushes. She feels faint. “…I’m sorry. You’ve been so good to me, Nisha; I’m sorry I’m so useless—”</p>
<p>Nishvir stands, touches her cheek gently. “You have done so much already. I want to show you that you can let yourself be vulnerable again, Savi. You’re not a prisoner anymore. You don’t have to keep carrying everyone around you alone.”</p>
<p>Savren tries to look down but Nishvir catches her chin, holds her head back up. Tears are starting to trickle down her cheeks. “Hey,” he says, for a moment all the military professionalism gone from his voice. “You don’t have to be in control anymore. You don’t have to hide it anymore. You’re among your own now.”</p>
<p>She tries to speak but she’s too choked up. Nishvir brushes away the tears, sitting back down across from her, taking her hands in his. “You are safe again, Savi,” he says.</p>
<p>Savren glances around the train, instinctively braced for mockery.</p>
<p>Everyone is standing at attention. At her glance, they salute her. Nothing in their faces but admiration. And care.</p>
<p>She buries her head in Nishvir’s shoulder. Behind her, Vasuen puts a gentle hand on her back.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get here a moment too soon,” she murmurs to him.</p>
<p>Still holding Savren in his arms, Nishvir glances up at his officers. “Alright, people. What have we got?”</p>
<p>“I… the disposition of Car One, sir,” says a woman, a distasteful look on her face.</p>
<p>Nishvir grimaces. “Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>“Whatever stability we’d gain by shipping them out first isn’t worth it anymore. We’ll save at least five hours if we just liquidate them on site.”</p>
<p>Nishvir rubs his temples with his free hand. “…agreed. See that it happens. <em>Discreetly.</em> Next?”</p>
<p>“Sir.” Another officer steps forward. “It won’t be comfortable, but we could overload the trains. We should be able to go a third past capacity without straining the engines.”</p>
<p>Nishvir purses his lips. “I don’t want to risk instability aboard. Giving some people seats and leaving others to stand…”</p>
<p>“Voluntarily, then. Offer standing room spots to whoever is scheduled for the next ride out.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I don’t like it but it could work. Work out the details.”</p>
<p>“Yessir!”</p>
<p>“Sir, we still have a complement of drones. They could harry whoever survives the detonations—”</p>
<p>“And then the Rosies would know right away who they were going up against, and send for even more backup. When we do engage it needs to be fast, brutal, come from every direction at once. If we give them time to get their bearings, we throw away the biggest advantage we have. Anyone else?”</p>
<p>“We could cut down the onboard garrison, sir. Risky, obviously—”</p>
<p>“Too risky. I don’t want to get all these people halfway to the Territories only for the Guard to board and take them all back. </p>
<p>A tech looks up from a terminal abruptly. “Sir, Trainset Two just reestablished contact. They’re one hour out.”</p>
<p>“Finally some good news. How close is the field headquarters to being ready?”</p>
<p>“We can transfer ops at your command, sir.”</p>
<p>“Then get it done.” Nishvir stands. “Savi, I’m going to be staying behind to command the camp garrison. I’d like you to be on the first train out of here. You are wounded, after all.”</p>
<p>Savren looks at him for a moment. Nine hours in a comfortable seat on a warm train and she’ll be back in Allied territory. Then soft beds. Doctors. A counselor. Debriefing. Friendly faces as far as the eye can see. Trees. Streets. Music.</p>
<p>Comfort.</p>
<p>She shakes her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving a job half-done. Besides, sir, this environment is volatile and the people here trust me. You need me here.”</p>
<p>A frightened look flits across Nishvir’s face. “After how far we’ve come to get the Second out—”</p>
<p>“You’ll get us out. But I’m not leaving until you do.”</p>
<p>“Then neither am I,” says Vasuen. “Put Tenuan on the first train. I don’t want him to see any more fighting.”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “He’s been treated worst of all. He shouldn’t spend a second longer in this camp than necessary.”</p>
<p>Nishvir inclines his head. “I’ll have him brought aboard immediately.” He glances between the two of them. “If you’re really set on staying behind, Savren-<i>roshlas…</i> then let’s move.”</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Her Ladyship Egret Sunshield, daughter to Raven the Baroness Sunshield and heir presumptive to Westlake Manor, Intendant of Labor Camp “Thricely Esteemed Congregation Before the Aperture of All Penitence” by appointment of Her Splendid Efficieny Regional Minister for the Manufactoriat Crane Bleakmorn, with the absolute power of life and death over more than a thousand souls, is shivering, shackled in restraints that once held her own terrified subjects.</p>
<p>Every last woman of the Empress left alive has been strip-searched. Forced out of their armor and clothes and made to bare themselves for the inspection of the heretic officers. Even after the ritual humiliation, they were given no allowance for their dignity but their underwear, if they were lucky enough to be wearing any.</p>
<p>Slowly, the room is emptying. One by one, the guards are being marched away to God alone knows where. Probably to die of exposure in the snow, Egret thinks dully.</p>
<p>They take Owl next. The two fix frightened eyes on each other as she is led away. Nothing left to say.</p>
<p>Then they come for the intendant. Gripping her roughly by the upper arms as they march her out into the snow. Barefoot. Chilly winds whipping and biting at her exposed legs and midriff. Her teeth are chattering so hard her mouth is filling with the taste of blood from her punctured tongue.</p>
<p>She doesn’t recognize her prisoners at first. The women and men crowding around the makeshift amphitheatre at the center of the camp are attired too warmly, some in sleek, alien fabrics, others in furs looted from the quartermaster. Then the crowd spots her.</p>
<p>Egret braces to be torn apart by the mob but they stand still, parting as the soldiers pass, nothing but a malicious murmur from those who recognize her to break the silence.</p>
<p>Then a voice rises above the rest.</p>
<p>“Will any speak in this woman’s defense?”</p>
<p>Someone Egret barely recognizes as one of her guards is kneeling, held in place at the front of raised platform by some Khmai brute. Tears are streaming down her cheek. She’s shaking and shivering worse than Egret. Blood is trickling from her lips. Behind her, a Green woman in a dress uniform. Some kind of officer, flanked my armored soldiers.</p>
<p>The crowd is silent. The Green bitch clasps her hands behind her back. Her eyes are pitiless.</p>
<p>“Then I name Swallow Greenglade an enemy of the People, of the Revolution, and of all the civilized galaxy.” The words are spoken without a trace of emotion. The officer sounds almost bored. “I condemn her to death, sentence to be carried out immediately.”</p>
<p>Weeping outright, Swallow is dragged to her feet. She flails madly with frostbitten limbs, trying to struggle against her restraints and the grip of the soldiers, letting out a pitiful wail. Egret is frozen, unable to look anywhere else, unable to think, mind filling unbidden with images of prisoners she had watched whipped to within an inch of their lives. The people she’d ordered left out in the snow for hours or days. The enemies of the Empress who had died before her own eyes, in their last moments writhing in terror and agony. A hundred different people’s faces and forms transposed onto the screaming guard—</p>
<p>The gunshot doesn’t shatter the air like the report of her black-powder pistol but the quiet <em>crack</em> is unmistakable all the same. Swallow’s body falls, suddenly limp. The officer glances dispassionately at her soldiers as they drag the body away, its blood staining the snow.</p>
<p>The mob roars its approval. Egret’s tears are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>The officer glances at her slate. “Lark Stonehearth,” she reads, as the next shivering guard is hauled up to the platform.</p>
<p>Lark is quiet, head lowered, making no effort to resist.</p>
<p>The officer continues. “By implementing the systemic mistreatment of proletarians under bourgeois rule, you are guilty of class treason under the Uniform Collectivization Code.” She turns to the crowd as the soldiers force Lark to her knees. “Will any among you speak for this woman?”</p>
<p>There is a long silence.</p>
<p>The officer turns back to the guard. “Then I name Lark St—”</p>
<p><em>“Wait!”</em> A frightened voice rises up from the crowd. A young man pushes his way to the front. “She— she saved me. Please don’t hurt her.”</p>
<p>The officer turns to him, expression shifting slightly. “What did she save you from, comrade?” she asks gently.</p>
<p>“She…” The boy’s voice falters. “She stopped… she stopped another guard from… forcing herself on me.”</p>
<p>“She brought me food!” A woman calls out suddenly. “When I was ill and couldn’t work. She smuggled me food from the barracks.”</p>
<p>The officer holds up a hand. She turns to Lark. “Is that so, Lark?”</p>
<p>Lark doesn’t look up. “I— I mean— they told us we was fighting for the Empress. That we was doing God’s work. I dunno. I dunno what’s right anymore. Everyone was hurting so much. I just wanted it to stop.”</p>
<p>The officer keys a line into her slate, then looks back up. She gestures to the soldiers, who lift Lark to her feet. “Lark Stonehearth,” she says, her voice kinder now, “You are remanded for transportation to the Territories for re-education. You will spend a term of labor in service of the Allied Powers, after which you will be reintegrated into society.”</p>
<p>Lark’s head lifts slightly, hesitantly making eye contact with Savren. “You… you’re going to let me live?”</p>
<p>The officer nods. “You’ve earned a chance.” She turns to the soldiers. “Dress her and secure her at the depot.”</p>
<p>Tears well in Lark’s eyes as they lead her away. “Thank you,” she calls back to the officer. “Thank you!”</p>
<p>Despite it all, Egret finds the strength to hate her for her grovelling.</p>
<p>“Owl Greenbranch.”</p>
<p>Egret tries to look away, but she can’t make herself. Owl’s frightened eyes are locked onto her as they force her to her knees.</p>
<p>“By wilfully and cruelly implementing the systemic mistreatment of proletarians under bourgeois rule, you are guilt of class warfare under the Uniform Collectivization Code.” A faint note of mockery enters the soldier’s voice. “Will any among you speak for this woman?”</p>
<p>The mob jeers.</p>
<p>“Then I name Swallow Greenglade an enemy of the People, of the Revolution, and of all the civilized galaxy. I condemn her—”</p>
<p>Egret squeezes her eyes shut.</p>
<p>“—to a lifetime of labor in service of the Revolution without prospect of rehabilitation, pending debrief by the Military Intelligence Subdirectorate and the Allied Intelligence Service. Take her away.”</p>
<p>Egret’s eyes open in surprise, in time to see Owl jerked to her feet and blindfolded. <em>They didn’t kill her?</em></p>
<p>Then the Green leader’s words come back to her unbidden.</p>
<p><em>I’m going to make sure you live a nice, long life.</em></p>
<p>“Egret Sunshield.”</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Savren watches from the window of the new command post as the first 200 people stream aboard the trains. Despite herself, she can’t help but feel a twinge of panic. <em>What if they leave and never come back?</em></p>
<p>“The list you asked for, comrade?”</p>
<p>Savren turns, snatching the slate. Her eyes scan down it, looking for anything, any numbers, any names she knows.</p>
<p>She exhales, handing it back to the intelligence officer. “Th-thank you. I’m— thank you.”</p>
<p>“No one you know?”</p>
<p>“No one I kn— <em>Otter!”</em></p>
<p>The boy is being led by another officer. Gone are his tattered prisoner’s tunic and breeches, replaced by a crisp white <em>rancal.</em> His long, scraggly hair looks fluffy and fresh; his face free of dirt and grime; his scrapes and scratches bandaged. </p>
<p>“Savi!” He rushes forward and hugs her tightly. She wraps her arms around him and ruffles his hair. The officer smiles politely at the reunion.</p>
<p>“Your aide has been cleared for the Green Zone, ma’am,” she informs Savren. “We took the liberty of getting him cleaned up a bit, as well.”</p>
<p>Savren smiles at her gratefully. “Thank you, comrade.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure.”</p>
<p>Savren takes Otter by the shoulders, examining his face carefully. “Are you alright? I know the interviews can be pretty rough.”</p>
<p>He nods, a little unsteadily. “I don’t, um. Remember, very much. A lot of questions. I think they injected me with something?” He squeezes his the bend of his elbow. There’s tiny bandage over it.</p>
<p>Savren nods. “You’ll be fine, don’t worry. It just blocks short term memory for a little while. Makes it harder to keep up a coherent lie.”</p>
<p>“Ohh… that’s clever…”</p>
<p>Savren looks back out the window. “To be honest… fuck, I was scared they’d… I don’t know. Find something. That all this time you might have been lying to me about something important…” She clutches her head. “No. You’re real. This is real. You really are my Otter.”</p>
<p>Otter smiles up at her. “Of course I am, Savi! I get it, though. One day it feel like we’ll be prisoners here forever, the next…”</p>
<p>“The next, we’re in charge.” Savren laughs unsteadily. “I keep having to remind myself, just minute to minute. It still doesn’t feel real.” She squeezes the fabric of her uniform tightly.</p>
<p>He takes her hand gently. “Me too.”</p>
<p>She looks back at him, then puts a hand on his neck, pulls him close, and kisses him.</p>
<p>Otter turns red as a <em>pien şai</em> in freefall, stammering incoherently. </p>
<p>“I just. I needed you to know.” She looks down, blushing too. “In case— in case we don’t make it out of this battle.” She looks back up. “You mean so much to me, Otter.”</p>
<p>“I— Savi, I— gosh, I never— oh my God I love you. I never— I never thought I’d get to say that—”</p>
<p>She pulls him close, holds him tightly, strokes the back of his neck. “I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” she whispers, tears dripping onto Otter’s shoulder. “All I know is I don’t want to lose you.”</p>
<p>Her handset squawks. Instinctively she moves her hand to silence it, but stops when she hears her name.</p>
<p>“Savren-<i>roshlas</i> to the situation room. Savren-<i>roshlas</i> to the situation room.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly she disentangles herself. “I need to go.”</p>
<p>Otter nods quickly. “Go. Go! They need you.” He steps back but she catches his hand.</p>
<p>“Come with me.”</p>
<p>“…will they let me?”</p>
<p>“I can be pretty convincing.”</p>
<p>They make their way through bustling corridors down to the basement, which Nishvir has transformed into a C&C deck. They pass through a makeshift comms center in the hall filled with chattering radio operators, into a wide stone room filled with the commander’s staff. Projectors and thin-panel monitors litter the walls, filled with tactical displays and radar and raw satellite footage. Savren steps over a mess of hastily lain cables as she approaches the huddle at the center of the room.</p>
<p>The other officers present fall silent as they see Savren and Otter. Nishvir raises an eyebrow, studying Savren’s face for a moment, then lets it pass. “Comrade. Glad you could join us,” he tells her, handing her a slate. Vasuen breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Savren takes the slate. “Situation?” </p>
<p>“Three minutes ago we detonated a mine cluster on the tracks. The first trainload of <em>den tsuang</em> appear to have taken heavy casualties; they’re attempting to regroup as we speak. Shalvin, do we have an update on the rest?”</p>
<p>A woman steps forward and salutes briskly. “The remaining two trains appear to be proceeding unaware of the engagement; we can probably assume the first train’s radio, if any, has been destroyed. Unfortunately, train three took a route we didn’t anticipate and bypassed the third cluster of charges. The good news it’s delayed them by about an hour. The bad news is we only have one more shot; they’re entering the rail line at the same junction as train two.” She taps a position on the tac map, which has been overlayed with rail routes and icons for each trainset. “Whatever action we take, one battallion is going to get through uninjured.”</p>
<p>“How the fuck did they anticipate the charges?” Savren blurts. “Are they getting intel on us somehow?”</p>
<p>“We made the mistake of overestimating them, is all,” Shalvin replies quickly. “The choice of route appears to be simple incompetence; there’s no evidence they rerouted after we laid the charges.”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “Sorry. Overreacted.”</p>
<p>“Legitimate concern, comrade.” Shalvin smiles at her. “We have just under twenty minutes to make a decision. After that, the second train will be across the threshold and they’ll make it as far as the wreck here—” She points to the map. “—before they have to move out on foot.”</p>
<p>“We have about sixteen hours until the remnants of the first battallion reach the camp,”  Nishvir continues. “Assuming they even try. They were hit very hard. Almost the entire train derailed and from the look of it some of their ammunition and charges cooked off.”</p>
<p>“If we blow the second train,” interjects another officer, tapping the map urgently, “it’s likely the third will reroute through the pass and approach from the west. It’ll buy us some time—”</p>
<p>“—but then we’ll be trapped between two fronts,” Nishvir finishes. “Where as if we blow the third, the second will reinforce the first, but will be cut off from the wider rail network and will have no access to the pass.”</p>
<p>“That may be the preferable option,” Savren murmurs, staring at the map. “A direct loaded march is still slower than an indirect train. And they’ll be busy dealing with the wounded—”</p>
<p>“They’ll shoot the wounded,” Otter mutters.</p>
<p>Nishvir glances at him. “Speak up, son.”</p>
<p>Otter pales slightly as all the assembled brass turn their eyes to him. “I— I mean— well— mercy-killing is the best the armies can offer, isn’t it? You’d see them after riots, shooting their own in the streets, even shooting civilians who were too badly wounded. It’s not like leeches and bandages will keep a bullet wound from festering. I’ve never seen anyone who knows how to take care of wounds like you do, not even a doctor.”</p>
<p>There’s a brief, horrified silence.</p>
<p>“Barbarians,” Shalvin says quietly.</p>
<p>“So they’ll just blow right past.” Savren massages her forehead. “Fine. It’s still more time than we’d have if there’s even a single train with access to the rail network. I’d rather face six battallions on a single front than four on two.”</p>
<p>An analyst nods. “Concur, ma’am; even these primitive steam trains give them too much mobility.”</p>
<p>Nishvir stares at the map for a moment. “Let the second train pass,” he says finally. “Detonate the charges when the third is over them.”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>
<p>“Imagine <em>overestimating</em> a band of feudal barbarians who haven’t figured out how to build hand radios.” Nishvir sighs. “That just leaves the matter of the camp.” He glances at Vasuen.</p>
<p>“We’ve emptied the eastern half of the facility and have begun laying our remaining charges, sir,” Vasuen replies. “We’re currently identifying sniper positions and ideal ambush points.”</p>
<p>“I assume the objective is to buy as much time as possible to evacuate?” asks Savren.</p>
<p>“The ultimate objective, yes.” Nishvir nods. “We’re still not settled on the best way to accomplish that. Brief her, Lenlis.”</p>
<p>The officer turns to Savren. “The question right now is whether we engage at range or wait to fight until we have them surrounded. Engaging at range would tip our hand, but it would force them to dig in. If we engage in the camp, we can guarantee heavy enemy casualties in the opening strike, but they’ll have gained ground on the depot. Not to mention it would put our people at greater ri—”</p>
<p>“Sir!” A tech at a terminal turns to face them. “We have confirmation train one survivors are pressing forward. Estimated at one-third battallion strength. ETA seventeen hours.”</p>
<p><em>“Shit,”</em> Nishvir hisses. “It’s like fighting a herd of wild <em>pien şai.</em> No coherent strategy. Barely any sense of self-preservation. They’re so damn hard to predict.” He keys his radio. “Put through to Trainset One.”</p>
<p>A pause. Then, <em>“Receiving, ground ops.”</em></p>
<p>“How long until you’re away?”</p>
<p><em>“Just raising the ramps now. Train is at capacity. Over.”</em></p>
<p>“Good. Stay safe out there. Nishvir out.”</p>
<p>Savren exhales. “Is there any chance it’ll be back before we’ve engaged the enemy?”</p>
<p>“Practically none,” replies an analyst. “Eighteen hours is an optimistic prediction, frankly. Imperial railways are a mess.”</p>
<p>The radio crackles. <em>“All units, be advised. Trainset One is away. Repeat, Trainset One is away.”</em></p>
<p>“How likely are they to face trouble en route?” asks Savren. “We have to assume the Rosies have alerted every depot in the area.”</p>
<p>“The trains are running the colors of an Imperial luxury passenger corporation. We had no issues on the ride out, and we’ve taken the main regional signalling depot.” Nishvir points to an icon on the map. “Once we’re through it, we’re back into the public side of the network, and as soon as we cross back into the Territories, we unload.</p>
<p>“My main concern,” he continues, “is the Rosies might decide to dynamite the tracks themselves. But these tracks are used for all the cargo from the labor camps. Taking them out of commission would impact their economy and the war effort.”</p>
<p>“What are our contingencies?”</p>
<p>“Seluin?”</p>
<p>“Sir. The depot has sufficient troops to commandeer a further trainset from the public network to facilitate transfer across any damaged section of tracks. If the trains are stopped for inspection and we can’t talk our way through, we take the depot by force. The Rosies don’t have the resources to garrison every single one.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to make this run an awful number of times.” Savren drums her fingers. “How exactly did you get a train behind enemy lines from the Territories, anyway?”</p>
<p>“This world is old, comrade.” Seluin keys a contact and the map shifts to overlay a mass of tangled lines. “Not even the Rosies have mapped every rail line, especially the underground ones.”</p>
<p>“You found a route they haven’t blocked off?”</p>
<p>“We did.”</p>
<p>Savren nods. “Okay. That makes me feel a little bit more confident.”</p>
<p><em>“All units. Trainset Two is away. Repeat, Trainset Two is away.”</em></p>
<p>Savren takes a deep breath. “Well,” she says. “That’s it, then. We’re committed now.”</p>
<p>Nishvir glances at her. “Any regrets?”</p>
<p>“…no. I’m scared, sir. But no. I need to be here.”</p>
<p>The commander pats her gently on the shoulder. He says nothing, turns to Otter, switching to Zia Ţai. “What about you, young man?”</p>
<p>Otter takes Savren’s hand protectively. “Where she goes, I go,” he replies in Ranuir.</p>
<p>Nishvir smiles. “I can see why she likes you.”</p>
<p>Otter stammers. “I—”</p>
<p>“He’s the only reason I survived,” Savren murmurs, glancing fondly at the boy.</p>
<p>Nishvir bows. “Thank you for that, Otter<em>-surin.”</em></p>
<p>Otter blushes. “Oh. Gosh. I’m just so glad she made it back to you. Sir.”</p>
<p>“And I’m glad you made it to us. You belong with the Allies, comrade.”</p>
