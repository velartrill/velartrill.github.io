<section> <header>Mr. Montague</header>
	<p>Alright, who started it this time? Benvolio? You see what happened?</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>Some of our guys were fighting Capulet's, boss. I tried to stop them but then that
	cunt Tybalt came after me with a fucking gun. I guess the gunshots drew a crowd.
	It was all kind of a blur until the Chief showed up.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Mrs. Montague</header>
	<p>Romeo wasn't involved in this, was he? Was my dear boy hurt?</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>No, no. I saw him earlier, actually. Had a bad trip at the club on Sycamore
	last night and I was trying to get some fresh air. Dunno why he was over on the
	west side, he's always too prissy to come skirt-chasing with me and the boys, but
	it looked like he was out for a walk. I tried to catch up with him but I think he
	wanted to be alone too. Ran off into the Everglades and I couldn't find him.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Mr. Montague</header>
	<p>It's not the first time he's been over there. Spends half his mornings wandering
	around the west side crying his fool head off. Always home by sunrise though.</p>
	<aside>(sighs)</aside>
	<p>Then he comes home, locks himself in his room with the window shut. Lives in
	South Florida and the boy's pale as a ghost. It's not good for his health. Christ, it's
	probably time I found him a counselor.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>Shit, boss. What d'you think's up with him?</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Mr. Montague</header>
	<p>Damned if I know. I've given up prying it out of him.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>Maybe a pint'll get him talking.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Mr. Montague</header>
	<p>Hell, Benny, I've tried. And his friends have, the ones he hasn't driven away. They
	used to go out drinking every week but now he just sits alone and broods. If we
	could just figure out what's wrong with him, we'd do anything to help the poor
	kid.</p>
</section>

<aside>Enter <b>Romeo</b>.</aside>

<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>Hey, speak of the devil. Look, boss, lemme talk to him. I'll get the story out of
	him, one way or another.</p>
</section>
<section> <header>Benvolio</header>
	<p>Hah. Good luck, Benny. You'll need it. Come on, Sylvia, let's head home.</p>
