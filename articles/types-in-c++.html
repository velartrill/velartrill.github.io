<h1>c++ and integer types</h1>
<p>c++ (and c) have a problem. for some crazy reason that i'm sure made buckets of sense at the time, the original develoeprs of c defined the range of integer types in very... loose terms. there are some guarantees about the types, of course. all are guaranteed to hold *at least* a certain range of values, and most are guaranteed to be "the same size or larger" as another.</p>
<p>this of course means that using the built-in types, you have no idea how large a given int is going to be. the traditional way around this INSANE situation is not to use the built-in types at all but import a list of types from stdint.h defined in terms of how many bits wide they are (i.e. uint8_t). this works. it may be incredibly inelegant, but there's no way around it.</p>
<p>or is there?</p>
<p>the compiler knows internally how big each type is. surely there's some way to access that information directly, without faffing around with includes?</p>
<p>in fact, there is. c++ is the lucky host of a turing-complete metaprogramming facility known as "templates," which, while often completely fucking horrifying (because it's purely functional programming with incredibly awkward syntax built for procedural OOP), can achieve some really nifty things.</p>

<div class="box"><pre><code>namespace unsigned_integrals {
	#define entry(i,_u,_s) template &lt;&gt; struct entry&lt;i&gt;{using u=_u;using s = _s;}
	template &lt;unsigned char index&gt; struct entry { using s = void; using u = void; };
	entry(0, unsigned char,       signed char);
	entry(1, unsigned short,      signed short);
	entry(2, unsigned int,        signed int);
	entry(3, unsigned long,       signed long);
	entry(4, unsigned long long,  signed long long);
	entry(5, __uint128_t, __int128_t);
	#undef entry
	
	template &lt;size_t bits, size_t i&gt; struct select {
		val size_t v = (
			sizeof(typename entry&lt;i&gt;::u)*8 &gt;= bits
				? i
				: select&lt;bits,i+1&gt;::v
		);
	};
	template &lt;size_t bits&gt; struct select&lt;bits, 6&gt; { val size_t v = 6; };
}

template &lt;size_t bits&gt; struct ints {
	using u = typename unsigned_integrals::entry&lt;unsigned_integrals::select&lt;bits,0&gt;::v&gt;::u;
	using s = typename unsigned_integrals::entry&lt;unsigned_integrals::select&lt;bits,0&gt;::v&gt;::s;
	
};
int main() {
	using uint16 = ints&lt;16&gt;::u; // unsigned short
}</code></pre></div>

<p>so how does this unholy abomination work? first let's take a look at a simpler example so we understand the basic principles.</p>

<div class="box"><pre><code>#define val static constexpr
template &lt;typename T&gt; struct limits {
	val bool is_signed = ((T)~0) &lt; 0;
	val T min = (is_signed? (T)1&lt;&lt;(sizeof(T)*8-1) : 0);
	val T max = ~min;
};

// limits&lt;short&gt;::min == -32768</code></pre></div>

<p>this creates a template struct with a type parameter, T. all values are defined as static constexpr because this struct will never be instantiated (if you want to add a guarantee, you can add something like "virtual void no_instantiate() final = 0" but nobody ever does that) - it's used only for compile-time calculations.</p>
