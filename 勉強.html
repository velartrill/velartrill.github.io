<h2 id="do"><span lang="jp">いい事</span> ("do"s)</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="y1">
		<div><strong lang="jp">日本語を話して下さい!</strong></div>
		<div>speak japanese! having conversations in japanese is what this room is for, and it's only good for that if we stay on topic.</div>
	</li>
	<li id="y2">
		<div><strong lang="jp">敬語を使って下さい。</strong></div>
		<div>use the socially appropriate forms of verbs if you know them. this isn't japan, we're not going to get offended because you said<span lang="jp">「する」</span>instead of<span lang="jp">「します」</span>, but for the sake of fluency it's good to get in the habit of using the right forms in the right context. some guidelines:</div>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>use <strong>casual</strong> speech with people you're already friends with, who you talk to outside the channel. in casual speech, you use the plain verb endings, use second-person pronouns freely, and avoid honorifics like<span lang="jp">「〜さん」or「〜様」</span>. </li>
		<li>use <strong>polite</strong> speech <span lang="jp">(丁寧語)</span> with people you regularly talk to in the channel. in polite speech, you should use people's names instead of pronouns, the<span lang="jp">「〜ます」</span>verb forms, and appropriate honorifics like<span lang="jp">「〜さん」</span>.</li>
		<li>use <strong>honorific and humble</strong> speech <span lang="jp">(尊敬語と謙譲語)</span> with people you don't know yet. these forms are grammatically complex so if you're not there yet, don't worry — just use polite language instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<div><strong lang="jp">日本語で名前を選択して下さい。</strong></div>
		<div>nobody wants to switch back and forth between <span lang="jp">ローマ字</span> and <span lang="jp">漢字</span> just to type your name. either pick a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_given_names">japanese name</a> to use in the channel, or tell us how we should write your name in katakana.</div>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dont"><span lang="jp">駄目な事</span> ("don't"s)</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="n1">
		<div><strong lang="jp">ここに英語は駄目です。</strong></div>
		<div>english should only be used on the channel when you need some aspect of the japanese language explained. if you want to talk about anything else, speak japanese or find a different channel.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div><strong lang="jp">ローマ字で書くと良くりません。</strong></div>
		<div>don't use roman letters! reading and writing katakana is a vital part of modern japanese. if you have to transliterate some <span lang="jp">漢字</span>, it's best to use hiragana.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div><strong lang="jp">恥ずかしくないで下さい！</strong></div>
		<div>people often feel embarassed when they make mistakes in a new language, and it's important not to let these feelings get in the way of learning. you have to be willing to just say<span lang="jp">「しまった!」</span>and move on if you make a mistake. remember, nobody here is going to judge you or make fun of you — we're all learners too!</div>
