<h1><strong>日本語勉強部屋の規律</strong><div>japanese study room rules</div></h1>

<h2 id="do">いい事 ("do"s)</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="y1">
		<div><strong>日本語を話して下さい!</strong></div>
		<div>speak japanese! having conversations in japanese is what this room is for, and it's only good for that if we stay on topic.</div>
	</li>
	<li id="y2">
		<div><strong>敬語を使って下さい。</strong></div>
		<div>use the socially appropriate forms of verbs if you know them. this isn't japan, we're not going to get offended because you said「する」instead of 「します」, but for the sake of fluency it's good to get in the habit of using the right forms in the right context. some guidelines:</div>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>use <strong>casual</strong> speech with people you're already friends with, who you talk to outside the channel. in casual speech, you use the plain verb endings, use second-person pronouns freely, and avoid honorifics like「〜さん」or「〜様」. </li>
		<li>use <strong>polite</strong> speech (丁寧語) with people you regularly talk to in the channel. in polite speech, you should use people's names instead of pronouns, the「〜ます」verb forms, and appropriate honorifics like「〜さん」.</li>
		<li>use <strong>honorific and humble</strong> speech (尊敬語と謙譲語) with people you don't know yet. these forms are grammatically complex so if you're not there yet, don't worry — just use polite language instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<div><strong>日本語で名前を選択して下さい。</strong></div>
		<div>nobody wants to switch back and forth between ローマ字 and 漢字 just to type your name. either pick a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_given_names">japanese name</a> to use in the channel, or tell us how we should write your name in katakana.</div>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dont">駄目な事 ("don't"s)</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="n1">
		<div><strong>ここに英語は駄目です。</strong></div>
		<div>english should only be used on the channel when you need some aspect of the japanese language explained. if you want to talk about anything else, speak japanese or find a different channel.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div><strong>ローマ字で書くと良くりません。</strong></div>
		<div>don't use roman letters! reading and writing katakana is a vital part of modern japanese. if you have to transliterate some 漢字, it's best to use hiragana.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div><strong>恥ずかしくないで下さい！</strong></div>
		<div>people often feel embarassed when they make mistakes in a new language, and it's important not to let these feelings get in the way of learning. you have to be willing to just say「しまった!」and move on if you make a mistake. remember, nobody here is going to judge you or make fun of you — we're all learners too!</div>
