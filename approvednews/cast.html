		<p>Then there's the <strong>Blood-Soaked Maidens of the Cold Sword</strong>, who rule Eastern Oregon with an iron fist, talk like crusaders and have a tendency to lapse into Latin when they're angry. Nobody knows what they want yet, but they claim to oppose the "Celebrants of the Yellow Defiler," and they won't tolerate heresy. Or gluttony. Or “shiftlessness.”</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Democrats</strong>, who mostly seem to be normal people, but the DNC seems to be run by… something else, and Obama clearly has otherworldly knowledge that may or may not just be a perk of the presidency.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Republicans</strong>, who aren't much different from our world's version, except they occasionally use horrific bone rituals for secret goals. At least Rand Paul did; McConnell claims that was just a Tea Party stunt and the Republicans are firmly opposed to bone heresy.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Department of Necromancy, Mutilation, and Bone Ritual</strong> — the DNMB if you're a Beltway insider — which is presided over by a 7-foot Dread Secretary in an iron stag mask, whose name is expunged from all records upon nomination in accordance with ancient tradition. In the absence of an Old Forest-approved Dread Secretary, its officials carve weapons of stone and sinew and defend the department's office from interlopers.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Old Forest</strong>. Not a lot is known about it, but we do know the Framers made some sort of pact with it hundreds of years ago, and the Dread Secretary of the DNMB must be approved by it, as well as Congress. The ritual causes the entire country to enter the Bone Fugue for hours, and if the majority awakens unaltered, they know the new Dread Secretary has been accepted.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Forbidden Lands</strong>, a mysterious and melancholic place of red flowers, dim torches, and distant chanting, ruled over by a Shadow Council that seems marginally less cruel than the U.S. government — though it is tough on thought crime — and takes an active interest in world affairs. They have no truck with the Western gender binary.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Ashen Isles of Pain and Lament</strong>, whose young Empress, <strong>Vivian Torquist II</strong>, has recently gone missing, leaving her uncle Tormund the Grand Vizier to rule in her stead. Whoever they are, they're important enough for Kerry to visit to console the Torquist family and offer the U.S.'s support and ancient wisdom.</p>

		<p>There's the <strong>Woman in the Red Cloak and Oaken Crown</strong> and her <strong>Soldiers in Blackened Steel Armor</strong>, who besieged the Washington, D.C. frying chamber and rescued ex-Secretary of Eternity and convicted bone heretic Ian Sandoval from the clutches of the Dread Secretary. Whoever they are, they've got good intelligence, coming prepared with the only weapon capable of killing a Dread Secretary of the DNMB and escaping on a zeppelin hidden from the watching gaze of satellites by forsaken runes.</p>

		<p>There's <strong>Intel</strong>. God alone knows what they're up to, but their "Forsaken Bridge" chip has gotten at least one person killed horribly, and their executives cut out their own tongues rather than be compelled to testify by blood oath. Of course, as everyone keeps saying, it's probably nothing to worry about.</p>

		<p>And then there's the <strong>Illuminati</strong> — brutal, efficient, ruthless, and seemingly in it for shits and giggles half the time, they have spies everywhere, control everything, and have access to terrifying amounts of power. They'll kidnap people by teleporter, and they never return them entirely unaltered. They've quarantined entire countries for the good of the timeline on occasion. Their Inner Council is apparently immortal. But the Illuminati does seem to have humanity's (or at least causality's) best interests at heart, taking an interest in The Boats and putting the tourists who learned the terrible secret about them on a forbidden helicopter to the Forbidden Lands.</p>
