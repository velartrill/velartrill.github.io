       <div class="headline">All References to Canada Vanish from Known Textbooks</div><div class="byline">Sarah Bianchi, 16 May 2014</div><p>AP - In the wake of the Canada's surprise cancellation, all references to Canada in textbooks currently in use by the world's educational systems have been replaced by pages upon pages of jagged glyphs and unsettling illustrations.</p>
<p>Linguists at the University of Oregon analyzing the text claim preliminary analysis demonstrates certain similarities to the "Proto-Indo-European" language from which many European languages are thought to descend. "The writing system appears to be partially icongraphic, like the Chinese script," said Dr. Scott Delancey, "and we've successfully decoded a few words based on the rebus principle and linked them to known PIE [Proto-Indo-European] roots."</p>
<p>Delancey added softly, "In a way, I almost wish we had failed," before shaking his head and wandering away.</p>
<p>The text appears very similar to the text found on the obelisks recently released by President Obama, and while linguists have as yet had no luck attempting to translate either text, symbols corresponding to "darkness," "travel," "scream," "wide," and "sleep" are strewn liberally throughout both texts, suggesting a thematic relationship.</p>
<p>Republican critics have seized on the similarity to accuse Obama of responsibility for the massive wave of Canadian refugees impacting the northern border, though conspiracy theorists have downplayed the relationship. "The probably of a relationship is quite low," said Associate Professor of Conspiracy Studies Dr. Ángela Portillo, citing recent chemical analyses of chemtrails and troop movement patterns in southern Russia. "The more likely scenario is simply that the bone cavern summit obelisks were inscribed after the fact, and contain a press release on the cancellation of Canada - if there really <i>is</i> a bove cavern summit," she added darkly, refusing to elaborate, and abruptly departing in a windowless van with bulletproof siding.</p>
<p>At press time, four professors and seven graduate students had suddenly gathered in an empty classroom and begun shouting urgently at each other.</p>
