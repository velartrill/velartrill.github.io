       <div class="headline">SOURCES CONFIRM: They Have Betrayed Us</div><div class="byline">A Reporter, 14 Dec 2014</div><p>HEADQUARTERS - Multiple reliable sources this afternoon have provided “conclusive evidence” that we have been betrayed by precisely those whom we most feared.</p>
<p>“There can be no doubt,” said the grim, slender man in a tidy suit and gray pants, snapping the latch of a briefcase shut decisively. “They have betrayed us.”</p>
<p>The first evidence that we had all been betrayed was uncovered last week, but at the time we foolishly dismissed the possibility. “Only one group in the world could have done that,” said the tall, gangly woman with bright red hair and a jet-black suit. “We’re talking about an ally whose loyalty is beyond question here.”</p>
<p>However, doubts grew as the week drew on. Even the suspect’s staunchest defenders became uncertain after the revelation of particular facts. Finally, the appropriate individuals undertook the investigation deemed necessary, and received confirmation from multiple unimpeachable sources that the situation was precisely as they feared.</p>
<p>“The full extent of the betrayal is still unclear,” says the grim, slender man in a tidy suit and gray pants. “But at the present time we have to assume the worst.”</p>
<p>Analysts reported that ongoing operations would be “severely undercut” by the betrayal. “It may take years to fully recover,” said one analyst, on conditions of anonymity. “Right now, we just don’t know.”</p>
<p>At press time, the tall, gangly woman with bright red hair and a jet-black suit was firmly denying a disquieting rumor that was spreading like wildfire among her subordinates, while inwardly wondering whether it might somehow be true.</p>
