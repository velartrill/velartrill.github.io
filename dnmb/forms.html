<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>To request a form, please fill out Form X01-J "Request for Form" with the appropriate form number and revision.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Before filling out any form, you <em>must</em> file Form R37-7 "Intent to Complete Form" and wait to receive authorization. Be sure to have the form you intend to fill out on hand when authorization is received. Failure to have the correct form on hand may result in a $50 fine.</p>
<h2>Filing</h2>
<p>To file any form with the DNMB, follow this simple procedure.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Place the form you wish to file in a black, consecrated envelope.</li>
	<ol><li>If you do not have a consecrated black envelope available, file form F501-0 "Request for Consecrated Envelopes" during any harvest moon.</li></ol>
	<li>Seal the envelope with fly paste.</li>
	<li>Using a copper dagger, make three incisions in your wrist or the wrist of person authorized by Form C446-4 "Blood Proxy Authorization".</li>
	<li>Using the blood from Step 3:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>if you are using the SIGNATORY'S blood, inscribe a pentagram on the envelope's OBVERSE.</li>
		<li>if you are using a PROXY'S blood, inscribe an INVERTED pentagram on the envelope's REVERSE.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Sleep. You will dream of a ruined city, stalked by sorrowful spectres. One will come to you, and whisper a sequence of three words. You will awake.</li>
	<li><strong>DO NOT WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS.</strong></li>
	<li>Take the envelope to your local circle of standing stones.</li>
	<li>Place the envelope in the center of the circle.</li>
	<li>Speak the three words spoken to you in your dreams.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>If the spectre that spoke to you was REMORSEFUL, speak the words in REVERSE.</li>
		<li>If the spectre that spoke to you was PENITENT, speak the words in the ORIGINAL ORDER.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Light a match.</li>
	<li>Recite the full names and any aristocratic titles of your last seven ancestors. (For information on who legally constitutes an ancestor in your jurisdiction, consult a family law attorney.)</li>
	<li>Set the envelope alight.</li>
	<li>A cold wind will rise up. Close your eyes. Do not open them, no matter what you hear.</li>
	<li>Turn away. Do not open your eyes until you are 10 yards from the circle of standing stones.</li>
	<li>Do not look back.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure to follow the above steps correctly may lead to <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span></p>
