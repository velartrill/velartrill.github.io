<h1>Emergency Preparedness</h1>
<p>In our modern world of heresy and stone hoarding, it's important for every citizen to be prepared for <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> and other emergency situations. Here are some helpful tips on how you and your community can fortify yourselves against disaster.</p>

<h2>Supplies</h2>
<p>The most important part of emergency preparedness is making sure you have the supplies on hand to deal with injuries and threats. A lot of what you might need is self-evident, like clean water, bandages, and fire-blackened stones engraved with forsaken runes, but you might be surprised the sorts of things you could end up needing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Warm blankets.</b> Cold can aggravate injuries and even kill, so make sure you have blankets warm enough to guard against the Howling.</li>
	<li><b>Pocketknives.</b> Being able to cut fabric or sever an impure limb is important, but it's also a good idea to keep a pocketknife appropriately consecrated, so it can function as a weapon against the Ones Who Drink The Dusk. Do not hesitate. You must never hesitate.</li>
	<li><b>An aged bronze mechanism.</b> You will know its true purpose when the time comes.</li>
	<li><b>Insect repellant.</b> During a disaster, it's important to be able to determine the nature of the thickening swarms of flies. Do not doubt that the flies <em>will</em> come. Flies that are repelled by normal insect repellent are normal flies, and may be safely ignored. If instead they descend upon you and devour you from the inside out, they are from Hell and a <a href="res/portents.html#c9">Class IX Portent</a> that must be reported immediately to your local circle of standing stones.</li>
	<li><b>A pet weasel.</b> Weasels can smell the unclean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>Surviving any disaster is about more than stockpiling: it's about taking the right precautions. These precautions should help you keep yourself safe in the event of the inevitable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bolt down any object made of granite or oak.</li>
	<li>Always wear loose clothing if the sun rises in the west.</li>
	<li>Stay indoors during an eclipse.</li>
	<li>Make sure you and your neighbors know where the nearest leyline is.</li>
	<li>Practice not opening your eyes no matter what you hear.</li>
	<li>Last but not least, never, <em>ever</em> forget to <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span></li>
</ul>
