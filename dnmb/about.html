<h1>About the DNMB</h1>
<p>The Federal Department of Necromancy, Mutilation, & Bone Rituals is responsible for many tasks vital to the smooth running of the federal government and the <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> of all American citizens.</p>
<p>The most important task the DNMB is responsible for is maintenance of the terms of the Pact of the Old Forest. The position of Dread Secretary is appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by Congress and the Old Forest, and the Quivering Throne must always have a master, lest the Iron Times begin.</p>
<p>In addition to these duties, the DNMB serves to coordinate between the Old Forest and the executive branch. For this purpose, the Department maintains a pale, emaciated horde of forest animals through whom the Dread Secretary speaks, through unknown means.</p>
<p>The Department is also responsible for responding to and containing outbreaks of Contamination, the Hallelujah Virus, the Blood Plague, and <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span>.</p>
<p>The current Dread Secretary, <span class="expunged">EXPUNGED</span>, took office in 2014 after the assassination of his predecessor, <span class="expunged">EXPUNGED</span>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The DNMB is one of the oldest extant organs of the United States government, predated only by the digestive chamber of Congress. It was founded in 1777 in accordance with the Pact of the Old Forest, and the first Dread Secretary was the famous Mr. <span class="expunged">EXPUNGED</span>, whose name was immediately stricken from all historical record both past and present.</p>
<p>The Department's roles were greatly expanded by the 1944 <strong>Bane Unto All The Dead Act</strong>, a controversial but ultimately successful attempt to address the rising number of prophecies foretelling times of darkness and doom. Since 1944, the DNMB has been responsible for averting or forestalling not only the Iron Times, but also the Sand Times, the Gray Times, the Fallow Times, and the Flesh Times.</p>
