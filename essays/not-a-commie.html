<h1>why i’m not a communist</h1>

<p><i>by Lexi Summer Hale (<a href="https://twitter.com/velartrill">@velartrill</a>)</i></p>

<p>i’m gonna say straight off that if you’re looking for a “why i used to be a bleeding-heart pot-smoking liberal but have come embrace suit-wearing free-market jesus” article you can fuck off. i’m not a commie but i’m no baby-eating neoliberal.</p>

<p>this also isn’t a single monolithic thinkpiece. i fully expect that i’ll be adding to this and clarifying it over time as my thoughts on this get more organized - anxiety, a poor memory, and chronic pain sadly do not make great writing aids.</p>

<p>anyway.</p>

<p>first i think it’s a good idea to clear up some misconceptions about communism. there’s sort of this attitude that communism is this ill-defined, warm and fuzzy notion of “everybody works for the greater good and everybody is equal and from each according to her ability to each according to her need!11!1” this is certainly what a lot of ppl calling themselves communists seem to define the word as (as well as a lot of sadistic wingnuts who think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">that caring about another human being is the worst sin you could possibly commit</a>), and maybe that’s what the word is going to come to mean. if and when that comes to pass, then by definition i’ll be a communist, but right now i’m going to talk about the communism that leftist agitators tend call for, that Karl Marx prescribed - a specific and concrete ideology.</p>

<p>that communism, the communism of Marx, is not a soft and fuzzy toy. it’s a cold, razor-sharp approach to political organization. it takes a particular set of goals as the ultimate moral good, and discounts everything lost on the road to get there as a necessary sacrifice. this is the ideology i object to, and i’m going to outline my objections in listicle format b/c i’m a horrible, horrible person.</p>

<p><h1>1. communism is stateless.</h1></p>

<p>this is a very, very big discussion in and of itself, and i’ll try not to get lost in the details and/or ranting. the ultimate goal of communism is that the state should “wither away,” that under full communism, mechanisms of violent coercion will no longer exist. (where does this sudden jump to violence come from? the commonly-accepted definition of a state is an entity that maintains a monopoly on <em>the legitimate use of force</em>.)</p>

<p>thinking about this for ten seconds shows how utterly batshit insane a proposition like this is. if you remove all elements of coercive force from a society, <em>you are staking that entire society and its future on the goodwill of literally every single individual person who it will ever host.</em> because there’s nothing to stop them from starting to use violent coercion themselves. the rest of society has two choices: submit, or take up use of force as well - and if there’s no unitary authority, you’re going to have a ton of different people taking up arms with god knows what ends, and very quickly the situation will devolve into, y’know, Somalia. basically, if Socialism is the predecessor to Full Communism, then Full Communism is the predecessor to total anarchy.</p>

<p>communists often handwave this as “oh we’ll be <em>better than that</em> by then” or something similar. which, okay, fine, let’s posit that human nature really is that flexible. you still have a system that cannot cope with psychopaths. hell, they don’t even need to be violent. without a system of authority in place, without people watching out to make sure their positions of power are not usurped, there’s nothing to stop one charming, charismatic psychopath from taking over an entire society. and yes, we have that same problem now, and we will under any conceivable system, but the difference is that now we at least have checks in place that limit the damage any one psychopath can do. if you’ve achieved Full Communism and the state has withered away, the only checks left are individual people of that society - and if the field of social engineering has taught us anything, it’s that anybody who hasn’t learned better the hard way is a mark just waiting for a good con to come along.</p>

<p>tl;dr you need a system that can be resilient against evil that comes from within, and communism is not that system.</p>

<p>so that covers some of the mechanical reasons why a stateless society is a horrible idea. let’s get on to the moral ones.</p>

<p>a state is the only thing that can enforce unpopular structures. you know what’s never popular? racial equality. queer people. trans people especially. feminism. not being allowed to abuse your children. without a state, cultural minorities and traditionally disempowered individuals have no avenue to liberation. without a state, there’s no way to cancel the effects of individual bigotry. even with a state, in America, it’s <em>de facto</em> legal for white cops to murder black children because courts refuse to convict them - imagine how much worse it would be without. you need a state to drag the regressive bigots kicking and screaming into the daylight, because they will never come quietly, and they’ll bolt back to their caves the second you give them the chance to.</p>

<p>you also need some sort of mechanism to enforce social structures - to provision welfare, to prevent individuals from amassing personal wealth that would give them power over others, et cetera. generally this is a role filled by states, but i’m not convinced it’s impossible to implement them without having the monopoly on force that defines a state. one way or another, you need some sort of coherent institution for this - you can’t rely on the generosity of your neighbors if your neighbors are white fundamentalist Christians and you’re a gay Muslim.</p>

<h2>2. Marx was a classist prick</h2>

<p>communist ideology was designed around a particular idea of class: economic class. it was built around the patterns Marx observed, and built to liberate the people he deemed important. but in this function, communism is tainted by Marx’s own unexamined classism - his contempt and disdain for the common people, his outright seething whorephobia. this festered into a concept crucial to the communist idea of revolution: the delightfully-named <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>.</p>

<p>the Lumpenproletariat is Marx’s cute little word for people he dismissed entirely from the concerns of communism. it was his word for what Ayn Rand would later term “the Looters,” small-minded parasites on civilisation, who benefitted from the status quo and would never willingly sacrifice of themselves for the glorious communist future Marx had so thoughtfully designed for them.</p>

<p>so who all formed this dastardly <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>? well, here’s Marx’s charming description:</p>

<p><blockquote></p>

<p>Alongside decayed roués with dubious means of subsistence and of dubious origin, alongside ruined and adventurous offshoots of the bourgeoisie, were vagabonds, discharged soldiers, discharged jailbirds, escaped galley slaves, swindlers, mountebanks, lazzaroni, pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers, maquereaux [pimps], brothel keepers, porters, literati, organ grinders, ragpickers, knife grinders, tinkers, beggars — in short, the whole indefinite, disintegrated mass, thrown hither and thither, which the French call la bohème.</p>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>get all that? slaves, sex workers, beggars, the destitute lower class, anyone desperate to scrape by are all refuse in Marx’s mind. he knew his communism would not lift them up, and so he declared them unable to achieve class consciousness and authorized communism’s adherents to throw them all under the bus.</p>

<p>of course, this section has pretty much just been a hit piece on Marx, hasn’t it? it doesn’t necessarily reflect the opinions and goals of modern-day communists, does it?</p>

<p>well, sadly, it apparently does. i’ve had self-proclaimed communists say to my face that i should be willing to die from neglect (i’m permanently disabled due to fibromyalgia and severe depression & anxiety disorders, and dependent for survival on welfare & the ability of others to transfer capital over long distances) for the glory of the Revolution. that because i’m in a minority, me and people like me are an acceptable casualty. that the needs of the able-bodied, cisgender, heterosexual many outweigh the needs of the marginalized, disabled, transgender, queer few. Marx wouldn’t have hesitated for a second to write me & mine off as <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>, and neither it seems do his intellectual descendents.</p>

<p>in other words (words Marx might better understand), communism is some bourgeois-ass shit. it’s no coincidence that communism seems to attract so many young cishet white males with more time than sense: they’re the ones it was always meant to benefit.</p>

<h2>3. communism is an ideology</h2>

<p>i’ve saved this for last because it’s a more basic - shall we say, ideological - objection to communism. an ideology is not shaped in response to the conditions of a world to address its problems; instead, it calls for the conditions of that world to be reshaped so that its problems are the ones that that ideology solves. it’s diametrically opposed to the idea of harm-reduction, of giving people what they need today to continue under an intolerable system.</p>

<p>this is just not a mature way of looking at the world. ideology is what led to the clusterfuck of Western “democratization” of African societies. Western colonial powers imposed on those societies a system that was invented by Westerners to address Western needs, and that system, combined with arbitrary national boundaries that did not reflect the national unity of a region - completely and colossally failed in societies that were <em>nothing</em> like the societies that thought it up. trying to implement communism in the real world, with real people, would be a disaster for the same reason - it solves the problems of a long-dead white man’s fantasy world, not the world that currently exists, or has ever existed. (see <strong>Marx was a classist prick</strong> above).</p>

<p>i’m not a communist. i’m not a socialist. i’m not an anything-ist because the world is a complicated, constantly-changing place, and doing good requires a flexibility of thought and action that ideology restrains you from. if nationalizing the banks today leads to less suffering in the world, i’m 100% for it. if David Cameron fucking a dead pig somehow leads to less suffering in the world tomorrow, i’m 100% for that as well.</p>

<p>some might accuse me of wanting to treat the symptom, not the disease. maybe they’re right. or maybe there’s a million different diseases that all feed into each other and we need people tackling all of them as hard as we can. i’m not smart enough to tell for sure. i’m not sure anyone is.</p>

<p>but whatever the case, i truly cannot believe an ideology as insensate and ill-conceived as communism is the answer.</p>

<p>socialism sounds nice, tho.</p>
