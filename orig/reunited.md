# Reunited

The first few rays of golden sunlight pierce Niltar's eyes as she stirs in bed. She winces, turning her head away from the window, momentarily confused by the unfamiliar surroundings -- and then as her memories begin to catch up with her, her eyes start to sting with all-too-familiar tears.

The trembling of her body against his is enough to rouse Livkir. Blinking sleepily, he strokes her bare back and she presses her forehead against his chest, trying to bury her tears. "Hey," he murmurs softly, tugging the blankets up to her shoulders. "It's okay. It's gonna be okay, Nil."

"It wasn't a dream, right?" Her voice quivers as she speaks, riven with terror and doubt. "That wasn't just a dream--"

"It wasn't just a dream. They're letting her go. We're gonna get her back."

Niltar's shoulders sag and she begins to sob quietly, tears of relief streaking her cheeks. Livkir wraps an arm around her waist and cups the back of her neck in his free hand, pulling her closer and kissing her softly on the top of the head. He can feel her heart pounding up against his chest. It takes a while for her to calm down, and when her tears finally stop, her muscles slacken in Livkir's grip, and she closes her eyes, spent.

"Thank you," she whispers hoarsely.

"I wish you'd told me." He squeezes the back of her neck gently, eliciting a flicker of a smile and quiet, involuntary little sound. "I'm so sorry you had to go through two whole nights of sleeping alone."

"I never thought…" She trails off and shakes her head.

Livkir sighs. "You really still think I'm just putting up with you for Cas' sake."

After a long moment, she gives a small nod, burying her face in a pillow.

"Nil. You are a brilliant, passionate, thoughtful, creative, incredibly fun girl. The dysfunction isn't all you are; it never has been. All those nights the three of us spent together — did you think I was just pretending to laugh at your jokes? To be interested in all your stories about subnet drama? Stars and skies, Nili, I've had one of your paintings up over the sofa for years." He ruffles her hair. "Did you really think all of that was insincere?"

She exhales. "I… I guess." Livkir rolls his eyes.

"You're ridiculous." He takes her by the chin and forces her to turn towards him. "Nili, look me in the eye. *You are important to me.* You're not just… just an extension of Cas. You don't stop mattering just because she's not here. *You are my friend* and I care about you deeply, and I always, always will. Remember that pledge we all made to each other? Over shots out on the deck last New Year?"

She nods slowly, smiling ever so faintly at the memory. "Yeah."

"I meant every word I said."

She closes her eyes, nods again. "I did too."

"So no more of this attitude, okay, Nil? Stop treating yourself like you don't matter. Even if you can't accept that you matter to anyone else but Cas -- to Sal, to Shay; I swear, even to Lisuan, in her own way -- accept that you matter to me. Please."

"…okay."

"Thank you." Livkir hugs her again; she murmurs sleepily and wraps her arms around his neck and shoulders. He strokes her thigh and neck as she lays there, and she giggles softly.

"Mmh. That feels nice. Did Cas teach you how to handle me or something?"

Livkir laughs. "No, silly. I just kept trying 'til I got a smile out of you." He squeezes her thigh and she lets out an involuntary squeak, cheeks reddening. "Like that. Gosh, you're so sensitive."

"Well, yeah, I'm not some big dumb *boy,*" Niltar mutters, nuzzling his cheek.

"It's not just that. You're way more responsive than any other girl I've ever cuddled with or fucked. That a _ceshvol_ thing or something?"

She shrugs. "Maybe? Never asked." In a quieter voice she adds, "Probably has something to do with going all those years without anyone so much as laying a hand on me."

"…oh, Nili. No wonder you didn't want to sleep alone."

She flops over on her back, staring at the ceiling. "You wanna know something fucked up?"

"Always."

"I used to get myself in trouble on purpose just so I'd get flogged for it. Because that was the only time anyone ever touched me. And hurting on the outside still felt so much better than hurting on the inside."

"Oh, *Nili.*"

"I think that's why Sal was so worried yesterday. He thought I was doing the same old shit again."

"Come *here.*" Livkir pulls her back into his arms and he feels her muscles slacken automatically, the way they always do when she wants to be held. "Stars above, Nili, you poor thing. How long did that go on?"

Niltar sighs. "Sal put a stop to it when he figured it out. I cried in his office and I begged him not to. That was actually what ended up with him introducing Cas to me. She wasn't even supposed to be my _vartash_ at first, just… someone who could 'meet my needs,' was how Sal put it."

"Someone to cuddle with?"

Niltar looks away. "Someone to hurt me. So I could have those sensations without causing trouble for anyone else."

"You *wanted* to be hurt?"

"It just… I don't know. Sal thinks it's just 'cause I spent all that time with nothing else like intimacy in my life except for beatings, and it burned some kind of connection into my brain circuits between… pain and feeling safe. Or not alone. Or something." She shrugs. "All I know is, when Cas would… do things to me, it felt so good. *Feels* so good," she corrects herself, glancing away, cheeks aglow with embarassment.

Livkir gazes at her for a long moment, then pulls her head in under his chin and hugs her tightly. "I don't know what to say," he murmurs at last. "I just… I'm sorry I never made the effort to get to know you back then. I'm so sorry you had to be so alone. Nobody should ever have to go through something like that, least of all someone with *ceshvol.*"

"Turned out alright, didn't it?" Niltar shrugs as Livkir loosens his grip, looking up into his brilliant green eyes. "Like… I don't know. I don't think of it like that. Being able to feel pain the way I do… I treasure it, Liv, I really do. Maybe that's a fucked up thing to say but— nothing else feels the same. Nothing else pushes that same set of buttons. It's so special and intimate and being able to share that with Cas… sometimes it almost makes me feel like it was meant to be this way."

Livkir gives her a faintly sad smile, rubbing the back of her neck, a little more forcefully than before. "I'm… I'm glad you got something positive out of it, Nili. I really am."

"Mmh. Liv?"

"Yeah?"

"Would… do you think… could you maybe give me a backrub? I just… I haven't had one in so long and--"

He tousles her hair. "I'd love to. Come on, turn over."

Niltar twitches slightly as he works her over, massaging her with just enough force to send little jolts of pain through her nerves. "…ahh, gosh. I d-don't deserve this," she whispers, eyelids fluttering. "I don't deserve *you*."

"Sure you do," he replies lightly. "I don't ever want you to be lonely again, Nili. I don't want you to suffer. We swore we'd all look after each other, take care of each other for as long as we live. You deserve that kind of safety and security after everything you've been through."
 
She responds with just a happy little murmur, the way she always does when she's too overwhelmed with happiness and gratitude to speak.

"So *this* is how Cas keeps you under control, huh?" Livkir teases. "Just massages the defiance out of you each morning? I'll have to remember this next time you start swinging punches at me."

"I— I'm r-really sorry—"

"Shh." He touches a finger to her lips. "I'm just teasing you, Nili. I'm not mad about that at all, I promise."

"You're s-sure good at this. D'you practice on Lisuan, then?" Niltar manages a faint smirk. "Or should I say 'Lisi?'"

Livkir rolls his eyes. "I swear I'm not fucking Lisuan. That girl is too hardcore for me anyway."

"Then how do you know she likes pain so much, hm?"

"I should have known that was going to come back to haunt me." Livkir laughs ruefully. "Come on, Nili, you've seen her fight."

"So?"

"Her style's so aggressive. It's pure offense; she doesn't even bother trying to dodge blows. She just takes them and keeps on going. Haven't you noticed that?"

"I… maybe?"

"And she toys with people. She drags out fights way longer than she needs to. Shows off her bruises like trophies. Also like — you know how she gets when she's fighting. Her face, her body language -- the longer the fight goes on, the more *excited* she gets." He loosens his grip, strokes her tender skin with one hand, her flank with the other. "I don't know, I think there's something up with that."

Niltar laughs quietly. "That almost makes me wonder… maybe she's just using our UC sessions for the same thing I got myself flogged for." She flashes a cruel little smile. "Maybe she's just as desperate as I was."

"Come on, Lisuan?" Livkir shakes his head. "You know how many groupies she has. Half the girls in the cohort are nursing crushes on her."

"Okay but can you even imagine, I don't know, Silvar or someone like her *on top?* Of *Lisuan?*"

Livkir laughs. "Okay, yeah. That's a point." He scritches the back of her neck and she snuggles closer. "If that's true, then think about it -- she's got no one. No one to take charge, no one to comfort her, no one to make *her* feel wanted. No one to hold her when she cries. And you've got Cas *and* me. You're better off than *Lisuan,* Nili."

"Mm." Niltar nods. "Good point. Can't possibly be true then."

Livkir sighs, rolling his eyes. "You're ridiculous," he repeats, putting a hand on the side of her neck, stroking her softly.
