The first few rays of golden sunlight pierce Niltar's eyes as she stirs in bed. She winces, turning her head away from the window, momentarily confused by the unfamiliar surroundings -- and then as her memories begin to catch up with her, her eyes start to sting with all-too-familiar tears.

The trembling of her body against his is enough to rouse Livkir. Blinking sleepily, he strokes her bare back and she presses her forehead against his chest, trying to bury her tears. "Hey," he murmurs softly, tugging the blankets up to her shoulders. "What's up, Nil?"

"It wasn't a dream, right?" Her voice quivers as she speaks, riven with terror and doubt. "That wasn't just a dream--"

"It wasn't just a dream. They're letting her go. We're gonna get her back."

Niltar's shoulders sag and she begins to sob quietly in relief. Livkir wraps an arm around her waist and cups the back of her neck in his free hand, pulling her closer and kissing her softly on the top of the head. He can feel her heart pounding up against his chest. It takes a while for her to calm down, and when her tears finally stop, her muscles slacken in Livkir's grip, and she closes her eyes, spent.

"Thank you," she whispers hoarsely.

"I wish you'd told me." He squeezes the back of her neck gently, eliciting a flicker of a smile and quiet, involuntary little sound. "I'm so sorry you had to go through two whole nights of sleeping alone."

"I never thought…" She trails off and shakes her head.

Livkir sighs. "You really still think I'm just putting up with you for Cas' sake."

After a long moment, she gives a small nod, burying her face in a pillow.

"Nil. You are a brilliant, passionate, thoughtful, witty, creative, incredibly fun girl. Broken, sure, but your issues aren't all you are; they never have been. All those nights the three of us spent together — did you think I was just pretending to laugh at your jokes? To be interested in all your stories about subnet drama? Stars and skies, Nili, I've had one of your paintings up over the sofa for years." He ruffles her hair. "Did you really think all of that was insincere?"

She exhales. "I… I guess." Livkir rolls his eyes.

"You're ridiculous." He takes her by the chin and forces her to turn towards him. "Nili, look at me. Look me in the eye. *You are important to me.* You're not just… just an extension of Cas. You don't stop mattering just because she's not here. *You are my friend* and I care about you deeply, and I always, always will. Remember that oath we all made to each other? Over shots out on the deck last Year's End?"

She nods slowly, smiling ever so faintly at the memory. "Yeah."

"I meant every word I said."

She closes her eyes, nods again. "I did too."

"So no more of this attitude, okay, Nil? Stop treating yourself like you don't matter. Even if you can't accept that you matter to anyone else but Cas -- to Sal, to Shay; I swear, even to Lisuan, in her own way -- accept that you matter to me. Please."

"…okay."

"Thank you." Livkir hugs her again; she murmurs sleepily and wraps her arms around his neck and shoulders. He strokes her thigh and neck as she lays there, and she giggles softly.

"Mmh. That feels nice. Did Cas teach you how to handle me or something?"

Livkir laughs. "Like she'd need to. Handling girls is easy." He squeezes her thigh and she lets out an involuntary squeak, cheeks reddening. "You especially; you're so sensitive."

"Well, yeah, I'm not some big dumb *boy,*" Niltar mutters.

"It's not just that. You're way more responsive than any girl I've been with. What's up with that, Nil?"

She shrugs. "Dunno." In a quieter voice she adds, "Probably has something to do with, y'know, going all those years without anyone so much as laying a hand on me."

"…oh, Nili. No wonder you didn't want to sleep alone."

She flops over on her back, staring at the ceiling. "You wanna know something fucked up?"

He leans closer. "Always."

"I used to get myself in trouble on purpose just so I'd get flogged for it. Because that was the only time anyone ever touched me. And hurting on the outside still felt so much better than hurting on the inside."

"Oh, *Nili.*"

"I think that's why Sal was so worried yesterday. He thought I was back on my bullshit again."

"Come *here.*" Livkir pulls her closer, wrapping the crook of his arm around her neck, and he feels her muscles slacken instinctively, the way they always do when she wants to be held, whether she knows it or not. "Stars above, Nil, you poor thing. How long did that go on?"

Niltar sighs. "Sal put a stop to it when he figured it out. I cried in his office and I begged him not to. That was actually what ended up with him introducing Cas to me. She wasn't even meant to be a _vartash_ at first, just… someone to be with. Someone to keep me company and keep me warm at night." She looks down. "That was the idea, anyway."

"…what do you mean?"

Niltar looks away. "I couldn't deal. It wasn't enough. I was begging her to hurt me in the end, to… cuff me and beat me the way they did before. When she finally gave in a little, held me down and…" She shivers. "I think that was when I started falling hard for her."

Livkir raises an eyebrow. "You *wanted* to be hurt?"

"It just… I don't know. Sal thinks it's just 'cause I spent all that time with nothing else like intimacy in my life except for beatings, and it burned some kind of connection into my brain circuits between… pain and feeling safe. Or not alone. Or something." She shrugs. "All I know is, when Cas would… do things to me, it felt good. *Feels* good," she corrects herself, glancing away, cheeks aglow with embarassment. "Better than a fuck ever could. Just, emotionally, more than physically."

Livkir gazes at her for a long moment, then pulls her head in under his chin and hugs her tightly. "I don't know what to say," he murmurs at last. "I just… I'm sorry I never made the effort to get to know you back then. I'm so sorry you had to be so alone for so long. Nobody should ever have to go through something like that, least of all someone with your damage. I wish I had known."

"Turned out alright, didn't it?" Niltar shrugs as Livkir loosens his grip, looking up into his brilliant green eyes. "Like… I don't know. I don't think of it like that. Being able to feel pain the way I do… I treasure it, Liv, I really do. Maybe that's a fucked up thing to say but— nothing else feels the same. Nothing else pushes that same set of buttons. It's so special and intimate and being able to share that with Cas… sometimes it almost makes me feel like it was meant to be this way."

Livkir gives her a faintly sad smile, rubbing the back of her neck, a little more forcefully than before. "I'm… I'm glad you got something positive out of it, Nili. I really am."

"Mmh. Liv?"

"Yeah?"

"Would… do you think… could you maybe give me a backrub? I just… I haven't had one in so long and--"

He tousles her hair. "I'd love to. Come on, turn over."

Niltar twitches slightly as he works her over. "…ahh, gosh. I d-don't deserve this," she whispers, eyelids fluttering. "I don't deserve *you*."

"Sure you do," he replies lightly. "I don't want you to be lonely again, Nili. I don't want you to suffer. We swore we'd all look after each other, take care of each other for as long as we live. You deserve that kind of safety and security after everything you've been through; you sure have been here for me when I needed it."
 
She responds with just a quiet little murmur, the way she always does when she's too overwhelmed with happiness and gratitude to speak.

"So *this* is how Cas keeps you under control, huh?" Livkir muses. "I'll have to remember this next time you start swinging punches at me."

"I— I'm r-really sorry—"

"Shh." He touches a finger to her lips. "I'm just teasing you, Nili. I'm not mad about that at all, I promise. Honestly, it's kind of cute."

"You're s-sure good at this. D'you practice on Lisuan, then?" Niltar manages a faint smirk. "Or should I say 'Lisi?'"

Livkir rolls his eyes. "I swear I'm not fucking Lisuan. That girl is too hardcore for me anyway."

"Then how do you know she likes pain so much, hm?"

"I should have known that was going to come back to haunt me." Livkir laughs ruefully. "Come on, Nili, you've seen her fight."

"So?"

"Her style's so aggressive. It's pure offense; she doesn't even bother trying to dodge blows. She just takes them and keeps on going. Haven't you noticed that?"

"I… maybe?"

"And she toys with people. She drags out fights way longer than she needs to. Shows off her bruises like trophies. Also like — you know how she gets when she's fighting. Her face, her body language -- the longer the fight goes on, the more *excited* she gets." He loosens his grip, strokes her neck with one hand, her flank with the other. "I don't know, I think there's something up with that."

Niltar laughs quietly. "That almost makes me wonder… maybe she's just using our UC sessions for the same thing I got myself flogged for." She flashes a cruel little smile. "Maybe she's just as desperate as I was."

"Come on, Lisuan?" Livkir shakes his head. "You know how many groupies she has. Half the *girls* in the cohort are nursing crushes on her, to say nothing of the boys."

"Okay but can you even imagine, I don't know, Silvar or someone like her *on top?* Of *Lisuan?*" Niltar giggles aloud at the thought. "Shit, I don't even think any of the *boys* could take her, let alone her *groupies*. Remember that one sparring session? Even Sarvash -- y'know, the Tier Null Oldworlder who spent like a decade breaking slaver ass on the borderworlds -- even he had to call it a *tie* after going at it gold-on-gold with her for like half a fucking hour. And he's the one who *taught* us all, for fuck's sake!"

Livkir laughs. "Okay, yeah. That's a fair point." He scritches the back of her neck and she snuggles closer. "If that's true, then think about it -- she's got no one. No one to take charge, no one to comfort her, no one to make *her* feel safe and wanted. No one to hold her when she cries. And you've got Cas *and* me. You're better off than *Lisuan,* Nili."

"Mm." Niltar nods. "Good point. Can't possibly be true then."

Livkir sighs, rolling his eyes. "You're ridiculous," he repeats, putting a hand on the side of her neck, stroking her softly.

"If it *was* true you'd obviously be out cozying up to her, trying to be her friend the same way you do every single other lost, lonely soul in Tegvar."

"That's not… well, that's not *completely* true—"

Niltar just snickers. "Liv, I love you but you are the most predictable person in our cohort. You--" She stops, as Likvir reaches past her for a slate on the bedside table. "What's up?"

His eyes move back and forth for a few seconds as he scans the text of the message. "It's from Saluin," he murmurs. "Wants us to come by his office 'when we have a moment.'"

Niltar sits bolt upright. "'When we have a moment?' Oh, fuck, I need to get dressed—"

"Jeez, what's the rush?"

"He's from the *Central Worlds,* Liv. They don't start tossing around *that* kind of language unless you're fucking *late.*" Her hand closes over her robe, and she freezes up. Livkir pats her back.

"Nili?"

"I just— I'm—" She wipes fresh tears from the corner of her eyes with a quivering hand; her breath is hard and hints of anger are bleeding into her voice. "Blood and thunder, why can't I keep it together for long enough to *take a goddamn shower—*"

*"Oh."* Livkir takes her by the shoulder, tugs gently. "Hey, like — if you want, we could try, like — we could just go to the guys' showers and if there's anyone else still there, I could just ask them if they'd be okay with you coming in with me?"

She looks up at him, eyes wide. "You'd… really do that?"

"Nili, hon. You keep acting like everything is such a big deal—"

"That *is* a big deal, really— it's completely against protocol—"

Livkir shrugs. "Well, we've got to learn how Saluin and his lot do things in the Central Worlds. I think it's only fair they learn how we do things in the Colonies."

Cassil attracts odd glances as she makes her way through the crowd. Unfamiliar faces are not exactly uncommon here, but with her head down and shoulders hunched, she stands out in a sea of smiles and soft, friendly chatter. The noise rolls over her and she shivers at its texture; she doesn't need to listen carefully to place the dialect of the people surrounding her.

*This is our capital.* Ours. *Why the fuck are* they *the only ones here?*

A series of faintly musical chimes rings out. The unfamiliar sound of a decelerating maglev catches her attention, and she spares an upward glance at the intercommune liner. It glides effortlessly toward her, silent but for an eerie electric warble and the quiet rush of air as it slows from frightening speed to a complete halt in moments. The huge vehicle towers over her and stretches away down the platform, dwarfing the little trams and streetcars that she's used to travelling on.

They offered her a choice. A priority seat on a sealed Core Line hauler, back to Tegvar in two hours tops. "Why? So you can keep tossing me around in the dark like a sack of _neshral?"_ she spat. The other choice was travel auth for a two-day surface rail trip to the other side of the continent, which she picked without hesitation.

*Let me out of these dank* sarsin *warrens already,* she thought. She's starting to regret it.

The crowd moves as if directed by a single overriding will, flowing with perfect grace into orderly queues around her. Cassil feels the urge to make a scene, push and shove and force her way through, give these snobby fucks something to raise their eyebrows about — but no. *I need to get back to her. That's all that matters. No more taking chances.* Gritting her teeth, she lets her programming take over, watching herself slip into place in the line from a distance as though her body's on autopilot, hands clasped dutifully behind her back, and bitterly swallows her self-disgust.

This would be humiliating enough if she wasn't surrounded by _vintashar._

A transit cop smiles at her as she boards; she rewards him with a glare and stalks off towards the stairs. There's no pass for him to check -- that all happened automatically the moment she stepped on board the train, and the absence of blaring alarms was all the paperwork she needed. *I bet they don't put Homeguard on their own trains. He's just there to keep us rowdy colonials in line.* She grits her teeth. *Why can't you smug fucking* suftefinar *just go* home.

She climbs all the way to the third level, and settles into a nook by the wall where she can see most of the coach, leaning gratefully back into the warm, soft cushion that wraps around the seat. With a swipe across the command surface at her wrist she powers off her suit's thermoelectrics, and reaches up to unzip the collar. It's mostly empty up here. The Cents won't come up this far until the seats below are all filled, one by one, and that's not likely to happen with a crowd this size. She stares out the window, past the tracks and into the lush forest that the station's architecture winds artfully through. *They won't even pick their own train seats. How emasculated can you get—*

"Forgive me, young comrade?"

Cassil spins, eyes fixing on the interloper, heart pounding all over again. It's the cop from earlier. She shrinks back into the seat. *"What do you want?"* she growls, trying to sound dangerous and cringeing inwardly when she hears the fear in her own voice. Her rough colonial cadences crackle and spit like sparks from a raw wire. The cop raises an eyebrow.

"I hope you will forgive the intrusion." He inclines his head. Around them, the train comes to life, and Cassil is pressed back into the seat by the sudden force of the acceleration. The officer doesn't even appear to notice, effortlessly keeping his footing. "It is most highly irregular for such a young woman to travel unaccompanied on an intercommune route, and—"

"I have every right to be here!" Her knuckles whiten. "I haven't done anything wrong."

"…unquestionably so," the officer concurs, taking a step back and regarding her carefully. "I did not mean to imply otherwise, comrade. My only intent was to inquire after your wellbeing; clearly you are in an unusual and unfamiliar situation, and to make matters worse you are alone in an empty coach level."

She stares at him for a moment, as though he's a riddle that will unravel itself if she just looks hard enough. His handset sits in its holster on his crisp and spotless light combat suit, a grenade waiting for its pin to be pulled. "I'm fine," she says. "I'm *fine,* okay?"

He bows. "To hear this gladdens me greatly." She flinches as he touches her softly on the shoulder. "May we in any way be of service to ease the burden of your voyage?"

Her eyes search his face for an answer that isn't forthcoming. His pretty green eyes and dimpled cheeks radiate nothing but innocent concern, tousles of platinum-blond hair that curl out from underneath his beret gently understating his authority. "I'm fine," she says again, more quietly, in a voice now simply sullen and exhausted. "Please just leave me alone."

"As you wish, of course. Please do not hesitate to summon me should you require any assistance or information whatsoever." He backs away, inclining his head again. "A pleasant journey to you, comrade."

"Whatever," she mutters, turning back to staring out the window, watching his reflection until he's out of sight. Only then does her heartbeat start to slow.

Sucking in a deep breath of air, she props her feet up on the opposing seat, and presses a switch on the table in front of her. The tabletop flips up, revealing a sleek screen on its reverse and a keypanel beneath; the screen blinks to life, her name appearing. Poking at the panel with one desultory hand, she keys in her ident sequence, and the computer unlocks, downloading her customary workbench from the Tegvar datacore. She lifts her hand to the screen, makes a few instinctual swiping motions in the air, and the screen shifts to her personal comms.

Thirty-six urgent messages from Niltar, of course. She sighs, hits the key to bring up their dialogue.

She stares at the screen for a moment, then buries her head in her hands.

*Fuck me.*

*Fuck me fuck me FUCK me.*

Her heart is pounding in her chest. She brings up the quick-nav but her fingers freeze on the panel as she tries to key in the phrase. She sits there unmoving for a moment, heartbeat in her ears, before she finally forces her fingers onto the keys. "Guardianships." She hits enter.

The screen shifts. Niltar's name is splayed across the top; below it, a table of irrelevancies — the relief she feels when she sees the little green lettering underneath is physical in its intensity, and she lets out a uncontrolled gasp. "IFF in range — condition normal." *She's okay, she's okay, she's okay!*

She swipes a hand across the screen. It shifts to a map of Tegvar, zooming in on a circled white dot at her next gesture. Labels appear on the screen. *Dorms. Male.* She recognizes Livkir's room close to the moving dot, and closes the tracker with a swipe of her hand, squeezing her eyes shut and taking a deep, ragged breath. *Stars and skies, Liv, bless you, you are the best friend in all of Haven…*

---

Niltar's still blushing faintly as she steps out of the shower-hall assigned to the cohort's male half, distractedly wrapping a towel around her upper body. Livkir, towel around his waist, takes her by the arm and orients her in the direction of her own dormitory.

"I have never seen you so flustered around boys, Nili," he observes; her cheeks redden further.

*"Neither have I—"*

"That was so nice of Caishen to stand guard at the door for you — I've always liked him."

Niltar looks away. "He just wanted an excuse to stand around showing off his muscles, I'll bet you anything."

"Here's a crazy thought." Livkir pats her back as he pulls open the door to her dorm. As they step inside, the recessed lamps in the ceiling light up to a gentle violet, Niltar's favorite color. "Have you ever thought about, I don't know — just flirting with people you're attracted to and seeing where it goes?"

*"How the fuck am I supposed to do that."*

Livkir furrows his brow. "What do you mean?"

"What do you mean, what do I mean? Like. I don't know. How do you always know exactly what to say? How are you so good at making people laugh? I mean, like, I can't just march up to someone and be like, 'hey dumbass, you're hot, wanna fuck?', you know."

"I mean, that would probably work on Cai—"

*"Don't tempt me."* Niltar tosses the towel over the back of a chair and yanks a pastel pink and violet _rancal_ from the dressing rack. "I have enough drama going on in my life as it is today."

Livkir pauses by the door. "You gonna be okay dressing on your own? Or do you want me to wait here for you?"

She gives him an awkward, guilty nod. "S-sorry, I just—"

*"Nili.* It's okay. You don't need to keep explaining your anxieties to me." Livkir rolls his eyes, letting the door click shut behind him. Niltar fastens the tail of her robe behind her and grabs the towel, idly drying her hair. Her eyes are wild, and there's a frantic note in her voice as she looks up at Livkir.

"Why is everyone being so *nice* to me, Liv?"

"What? They're just— they're just being normal people, I don't—"

"Yes, you do. Yes you do! You remember how people treated me… I don't know, a year ago." She throws her towel at Livkir, who catches it neatly. "Everyone's been acting weird lately. Being all polite and shit. The fuck is going on?"

"Nili." Livkir steps closer, puts a hand on her shoulder. She starts at the touch, her full attention landing on him at once. "The past is the past. None of us are fourteen anymore -- nobody's going to keep grudges from when they were a kid. And I mean--" He gestures vaguely at her. "Have you looked in a mirror lately, Nil?"

"The fuck are you getting at?"

"You're kinda hot, is what I'm getting at. You're not the… frumpy teenage girl who was always looking for a fight, who dyed her hair black and never cut it until it was so long she couldn't see. You treat people way better than you used to, you're fun to be around, you're…" He shrugs. "People like what they see now, that's all."

Niltar laughs unsteadily, heading for the door. "Bull-*shit.* Skies above, you're always such a… you always think the best of everyone. Always come up with the sunniest, happiest possible reasons for anything--"

"I'm serious, Nil." Livkir follows her out into the hall, gently steering her towards his dorm. "Come on, you can't seriously expect everyone to keep treating you the way they used to for the rest of their lives just because of how you were when you were a kid?"

"What, are they all going to just magically forget that shit I pulled at--"

"I might suggest, Nili," Livkir interrupts, taking her by the cheek and lifting her chin to make her look him in the eye, "that *you're* the one who's thinking too *little* of people."

She scoffs derisively, pulling away like a frightened animal. "Come *on*--"

"Dead serious, Nil. Remember what they taught us in Pol Econ? You judge a theory by its predictive value."

"What? What's that got--"

"It *means,*" Livkir continues gently, "that you should take our two theories, figure out which one predicts what, and then see which prediction lines up better with the observed data." He holds open the door for her. "I'll bet you mine's the good one."

She crosses her arms. "Loser has to choke down a bottle of Fernhollow Reserve?"

"The R1387 vintage?" Livkir winces. "You sure you want to do that to yourself?"

"You're fucking *on,* smug boy." She gazes at him defiantly as he dresses himself. "And you're going *down.*"

"You gotta cite some actual *evidence,* though," Livkir rejoins, waving a finger. "You don't just get to say, 'I was right, you lose.'"

"You think I won't be able to?"

"Honey, I *know* you won't." Livkir tugs his robe taut across his chest, finishing the wrap with a few practiced motions. "This is going to be one brutal lesson in humility for you."



The quartermaster eyes Livkir as he reaches for a slate. "The 1387 vintage?" he asks. "Someone lose a bet or something?"

-- saluin meeting
-- upcoming wargames offworld
-- saluin volunteered to be one of those staying behind, in order to take care of niltar & cas, she's aghast and feels horribly guilty
-- saluin arranges permission for niltar and livkir to travel out of tegvar to meet cassil at a train station
-- they wind up on the same train with lisuan, who is travelling to a neighboring rantal to attend a leadership seminar of some sort
-- they meet up with cassil. on the way back, they lose contact with tegvar
-- slave-raiders from imperial space take advantage of skeleton crew of adults when everyone else has shipped out to try and kidnap the kids, lisuan and cassi have to organize resistance and force them out
-- where did the raiders get their intel? MYSTERY1

-- cassil gets visit from deputy director of RSC
-- director tries to talk her into behaving and warns that she's making her job too difficult by bringing Oldworlder attention to it
-- "i'm on your side, *they* are the enemy, you gotta give me room to work" style lecture
-- she's friendly and respectful enough, and talks a good enough line that cassil hesitantly believes her, because she knows how to say exactly what cassi wants to hear

-- director is involved in conspiracy against Central Worlds control and is secretly trying to influence cassi to join up
-- lisuan shows up unexpectedly and coldly lectures the director about loyalty
"I'm afraid, since Cassi's unaccountably playing the suck-up for once, it falls to me to be the insubordinate one. Commune tradition, you see." Lisuan fixes the Deputy Director with an utterly unimpressed gaze. "You are quick to threaten force, and fearful of the dialectic. I could name certain others whom that trait characterizes, but I count myself a woman of manners."

The Director takes a long drag, staring unblinking at Lisuan. "If that's a Cent accent you're trying to ape," she says slowly, ashing her cigarette over the balcony with an absent flick of her wrist, "you're overdoing it by factor of near four."

"Perhaps you find my manner of speech offensive. I find a great many of your personal characteristics offensive, starting with your poorly washed hair, but again, I count myself a woman of manners. I see this is a difference between us. I must thank you, _Deputy_ Director; this meeting has proven unexpectedly edifying."


Niltar looks miserable. "Liv?"

"Nili? What's up?" He pats her on the shoulder; she doesn't react.

"I really feel like a piece of shit right now."

Livkir rolls his eyes. "Oh, come on. What is it now?"

"I had some time to think, after we talked early, and I just… blood and thunder, Liv, I feel like I'm just taking the worst kind of advantage of you." She squeezes her eyes tightly shut. "I feel so *childish* right now. You're so good to me and so generous to me and it's just been so much… easier to use you for intimacy than to actually, fucking, do this the right way. *Shalar uoli*, here I am, literally a teenage girl, and I'm still just… awkwardly cozying up to my friends when I don't have anyone to fuck. Our bet — it doesn't even matter, whether you're right or I'm right. It doesn't matter if it's easy or it's hard. I should still be going out and flirting with people and—"

"Hey, hey, slow down there!" Livkir exclaims, patting her cheek and leaning closer. "You are going at like one hundred klicks a minute here.


"I'm always gonna be here for you, okay? Always. I want you to be able to put yourself out there, yeah, but stars and skies, Nili, you don't have to just… deprive yourself and cut yourself off until you figure out how to do it all on your own. You are treating yourself worse than you'd ever treat anyone else right now." He pulls her close, ignoring her feeble struggles. "Shh. Look. You know that get-together Ferlis is having over in the boys' side of the dorms?"

She tilts her head. "I… heard about it, yeah. Wh-why—?"

"'Cause I think that would be a good opportunity for you. You want to learn how to flirt, okay, here's your first lesson: show up a little drunk in nothing but a *moncal* and pull your usual supercilious ice queen act—"

"—I am *not* a—"

"—and I give you my word the boys will be all over you. Shit, Nil, you think your past makes you unattractive to people? It gives you *mystique,* is what it does. Especially now with how hot you are. I don't think you really understand men — the first one to conquer *you* is never gonna stop bragging about it. I was gonna go anyway, I'd be happy to take you along and be your wingman."


There's a chirp from the console, and she opens her eyes. "Incoming message — Niltar Tegvari."

"Seruan-*nillas-san*?"

"Please, come in, dear."

"I've been—" the analyst flushes "—it's a bit of a personal project, frankly. Dating back to the Varshal mess—"

Seruan's attention is immediately laser-focused on the young man. "Brief me, please," she says in a voice whose urgent solemnity is precision-tuned to boost his confidence in the importance of his work.

It has the desired effect. He stands to attention. "There was something off in the post-purge workup we did. It was an, uh…  economic matter. We don't usually deal with that kind of thing; we were so fixated on the social situation — rightly so, of course," he interjects hurriedly before Seruan can raise her eyebrow at him, "— but there were some signals in the output numbers that caught my attention."

"How so?" Seruan tents her fingers in her lap.

"Well, ma'am. I looked over the labor quotas they were enforcing." He clasps his hands nervously. Seruan's heart pointedly does *not* begin to race, but it takes a distinct exertion of self-control even for her. "Something just seemed *off* with the output numbers. It was subtle, but I've done agricultural labor -- I know how much work one healthy person can get done, and even accounting for the colossally toxic social situation—"

"There's a mismatch," breathes Seruan. He nods.

"I've been collecting — in my spare time, of course! — collecting everything we've been able to put together about productivity metrics in pre-purge Varshal, comparing it to post. The pre-purge internal comms are *weird,* full of vague language and obfuscations and what smells distinctly like verbal steganography — forgive me, not my field of expertise — but they couldn't hide the labor quotas, and they couldn't falsify the external records of how much food and so forth we took in for distribution. I was pretty sure they were producing more than they let on, more than they needed to feed themselves, and, well, I was pulling at a thread and it… unraveled a bit more than I expected. I believe we've reached the point where it would be gross dereliction of duty not to inform you directly."

"It's not just the agricultural output, is it," Seruan says softly, a cold fist of dread seizing her chest.

The analyst nods rapidly. "Exactly so, ma'am. It's— everything."

"Everything?" Seruan stares. The analyst swallows audibly, and Seruan chides herself, dialing it back a touch. "Forgive me, but *everything?* As in--"

"As in all industrial output, Comrade Mediator." The analyst nods. "There may be some small exceptions in some of the more exotic goods categories, reflex-fabrication, those kinds of things. It's hard to tell, the base numbers are so small--"

Seruan quietly swears.

"Alright, alright." Safris materializes in the doorway and takes firm hold of the analyst, who is physically quivering and immobilized by terror. "Let me get the boy some tea before you give him a panic attack, *nillas-surin.*"

Seruan decides to put social graces before station, and allows herself a faint blush of shame. "Forgive me, comrade! Go, have some tea, and we can talk not before you're ready. For what you have already done I mean to commend you before the Control Council."

*"Seri, you're not helping!"* Safris steers the analyst away from the chagrined Mediator and closes the door pointedly behind her.
 
Half an hour later, Safris slips back into the office. Seruan is engrossed at her console, screens filled with opaque numerals and archival comms readouts and some extremely high-clearance internal Shevran tooling that even Safris doesn't recognize. Her workbench is so impeccably organized it almost enters the realm of self-satire.

"I think the last time I heard you swear aloud," Safris says quietly, arms folded, "was Varshal."

"This is worse," says Seruan frankly. Safris bites back the most violent oath she knows.

"Worse? Worse than *Varshal*, ma'am?" she finally splutters. "Didn't Varshal win the pan-Shevran award for Ugliest Mess in All Haven?"

"Those awards are a myth," Seruan says in tones of such grave, put-upon sincerity that Safris actually quirks the corner of her lip in spite of herself. "I should perhaps qualify my words; I've spoken without thinking overmuch today." She reclines, and, startling Safris, turns to face her. "In terms of raw human suffering, what our young friend has chanced upon is most likely far below the Varshal threshold." Safris allows herself a sigh of relief just before Seruan continues implacably, "The political ramifications are substantially more disturbing."

"That's *still pretty bad!* More disturbing than corruption or incompetence or ass-covering idiocy *inside the Shevran?*"

"On that subject."Seruan fixes her with a contemplative look. "I have an interview I mean to conduct in the Ultraviolet Block. I'm sure the guards there will more than suffice to ensure my safety, but I would have you at my side nonetheless." The expression that very briefly flits across Seruan's face is blood-curdling. "You might find it cathartic."

##

* Pervin is dragged in, dressed in a sheer tunic that does little to disguise the purple welts from her latest round of punishments and offers her no real privacy.
* Safris angrily swats her bruised rear when she has the temerity to address a Mediator as "comrade", provoking a howl of agony. "Be mindful of your place, girl. I will not abide a creature who hasn't so much as earned her *rancal* back addressing a Mediator as 'comrade'."
* display in frightening detail just how brutally the Shevran treats its own traitors
* "I will state explicitly what you should already be able to infer, if you paid any attention to your training. I am conducting a broad multi-round interview under inducement. This may or may not have been the first time we have spoken today. It is in your best interest to speak truthfully, promptly, and with appropriate deference, without variance and from the first. You are permitted and required to disregard the restraint parameters of any relevant controlled information to which you are privy. Deceit will be unsuccessful, and silence will be uncomfortable."

Safris swats Pervin's rear again for emphasis; the discipline collar thrums an angry warning as she nearly stumbles out of her restriction circle

 "Now. Why do you think you have been brought to this interview?" The gaze with which Seruan is regarding the whimpering waif would freeze the blood of an entire Planetary Coordination Council and have enough chill left over to drop the temperature halfway across the administrative seat.
* "It is not m-m-my place to speculate on such things, ma'am Mediator," Pervin burbles, eyes down, voice high and tremulous and tinged with raw desperation.
* "It is within my considerable power to lighten your punishments somewhat." Seruan tents her fingers. "If you give me reason to do so."

As Seruan seats herself, the door at the other end of the room opens. A full fireteam of Shevran footsoldiers enters, leading a manacled prisoner. There is absolutely nothing gentle in how they handle her, half-dragging her as she stumbles across the room.

The woman is dressed not in the usual white *rancal*. She instead wears a short, filmy tunic that clings tightly to her frame and does very little to disguise the violent blue and purple bruises along her thighs, buttocks, and upper back. A slim discipline collar is locked securely around her neck, easily capable of automatically immobilizing her with pain if she managed to break free of her captors.

That does not seem to be a likely outcome. The prisoner is painfully thin, kept on near-starvation rations that deprive her body of the nutrients and fuel needed by the more exotic aspects of her *randani* physiology. In her current condition, a baseline teenage girl could likely wrestle her to the ground without breaking a sweat.

The soldiers lead her to one of the constraint points on the floor. Its rim lights up as she steps into the circle, and a status lamp at the front of the collar blinks to life, assuring that its wearer is now safely secured. There is no seat for her, and they leave her standing. A specialist approaches and straps a small harness in place around the woman's forehead; more lamps light up as its sensors come online.

Seruan watches dispassionately as the prisoner is prepared for her attentions, carefully observing the woman's body language and microexpressions. Her gaze is fixated on the floor, and she flinches with every touch to her body. Whatever defiance was left in her seems to have been sufficiently squeezed out by her years of confinement and rigorous discipline. There is still the faintest hint of sullenness in her expression, but it vanishes as soon as she realizes the mediator is looking.

*Hm.*

Their task complete, the soldiers offer the Mediator their bows, which she acknowledges with an inclined head, and leave the room as quickly as they came. Seruan is left alone with Safris and the poor shackled wretch across from her.

"_Lif a tar_, Pervin Varshali."

The former Section Head twitches. "_Mai a vin, Seruan-nillas-surin,_" she answers in a very small voice, eyes not meeting the Mediator's.

Safris immediately stalks across the room and swats Pervin's battered rump with the back of a guantleted hand. Pervin squeals in agony, thrashing for a moment in her cuffs before she's able to regain some semblance of self-control. "Be mindful of your place, girl," Safris growls quietly, lips next to her ear. "I will not abide a creature who hasn't so much as earned her *rancal* back addressing a Mediator as 'comrade'."

_"Lahi narai elena r-risash,"_ cries Pervin. "I -- I take f-full responsibility for my inexcusable lapse in attention to decorum and I request that you assign whatever punishment you deem suitable, *varlas-san.*" The words come as quickly as if by rote. Pervin has clearly had to make regular use of them.

Safris responds with a disdainful sniff.

Seruan sits back, regarding their prisoner. The expression on the Mediator's face would freeze the blood of an entire Planetary Coordination Council and have enough chill left over to drop the temperature halfway across their administrative seat.

"I will state explicitly what you should already be able to infer, if you paid any attention to your training," she tells Pervin after a moment. "I am conducting a broad multi-round interview under inducement. This may or may not have been the first time we have spoken today. It is in your best interest to speak truthfully, promptly, and with appropriate deference, without variance and from the first. You are permitted and required to disregard the restraint parameters of any relevant controlled information to which you are privy. Deceit will be unsuccessful, and silence will be uncomfortable." Safris swats her rear again for emphasis. "Now. Why do you think you have been brought to this interview?" 

"It is not m-m-my place to speculate on such things, ma'am Mediator," Pervin burbles, eyes down, voice high and tremulous and tinged with raw desperation.

"Yet it is your place to evade simple questions?"



"Do you find your accomodations adequate?"

Pervin begins to tremble. Seruan eyes the laptop on her desk. The high-bandwidth data feed from the harness around the prisoner's head feeds into a multi-terabyte artificial neural model, trained and refined for centuries on *rantashar* and *uastashar* alike, whose most recent iteration is churning away on specialized processors in the annex datacore. The response isn't quite realtime, but the lag is seconds at most. 


Seruan glances at the laptop again, and raises an eyebrow. The readout is rather more interesting than she expected.

> Emotion: Fear (97% confidence)
> Intrusion countermeasure techniques in use (86% confidence). _Accurate decoding of complex cognitive states impractical._

Seruan looks back up at Pervin. "It appears that you have been concealing a particular skillset not normally considered appropriate to Shevran personnel." Pervin shudders. "I draw two inferences.

"Firstly, you reasonably assumed that revealing this particular skill in your earlier interviews would have drawn considerable interest from your interrogators, and perhaps induced them to pull at threads you did not wish pulled. You so greatly desired to avoid this scenario that you have been willing to incur considerable disciplinary penalties by leaving disharmonious thought patterns unconcealed during your evaluations.

"Secondly, my current line of questioning is so disagreeable that in order to obscure your mental state, you are now willing to trigger a particularly intensive course of investigation and interview to determine when and how you were trained in the use of defensive cognition, a skill you were never at any point cleared to know the existence of.

"I will be frank, Pervin: I do not expect this diversion to prove fruitful. I am a patient woman, and I am reasonably confident that you will lower your illicit defenses in face of sufficient inducement. It does not appear that your capacity to endure pain has improved during your confinement, while my capacity to inflict it is essentially unbounded."

The disgraced Section Head is trembling so violently that she can barely keep her posture close enough to attention to satisfy the discipline collar.


 "I will give you time to ponder your predicament. I recommend you think with some urgency, however, as your short-term memory will begin to drain within three minutes." Idly Seruan keys a contact, decreasing the postural tolerance of Pervin's constraint point by a factor of half. Pervin twitches in pain, straining to hold herself still. "If you find yourself unable to recall why you are in this room, you may call for the guards." Seruan stands, and without another word walks out of the room. Safris stalks wordlessly after the mediator, leaving Pervin to stand helpless and alone in her intangible cage of pain.
 
 
Seruan flicks her wrist over a control surface and Pervin lets out an audible gasp of relief as the constraint point goes offline, sagging in exhaustion as the guards take her by the upper arms.
