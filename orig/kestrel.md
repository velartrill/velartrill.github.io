"Do you even *understand* what would happen if you took point on the wrong mission and wound up with a magbolt through your skull or, God within, I don't know, had your guts splattered all over your subordinates by one of those… those bombs with the big 'foe' glyph on one side?" Egret Silverdawn jabs her finger into my aching ribcage and I grunt. The medic snatches her wrist and glances at me. I shake my head weakly, and he releases her, backing away with an I'm-watching-you glare.

"Claymores, Egret," I tell her in a hoarse whisper, staring at the ceiling.

"A claymore. What*ever!"* Egret clutches her forehead. "Kestrel. Darling. I understand your nigh-paraphilic need to be a… a trashy war novel action hero at all times, but there is *more here at stake* than just *you and your team--*"

I sigh. The dim lights of the triage facility sway in the rafters above as a shockwave from a distant explosion rattles the building. The shelling hasn't let up for hours. "Did you. Really come all the way down here. Just to--"

*"What do you think."* Egret squeezes the bridge of her nose. A dazzling flash shatters the night outside the western windows and a wall of noise slams the makeshift hospital, kicking up clouds of dust and sending civilian personnel reflexively diving for cover. Egret doesn't even blink. "What is this, three broken ribs? Shrapnel lacerations all over your thighs? Contusions bigger than my damn *skull?* Do you even realize how close you came to *death* today, *Commander?"*

"Wagbeak, I swear-- on Matikhe's s-*sainted* balls--" I turn in astonishment at the sound of the voice. Spar's *sitting up* somehow, glaring daggers at Egret, leaning heavily on her good arm. "The Commander--"

*"Lieutenaaant!"* The horrified medic rushes to Sparrow's bed and tries to press her gently bank down again. "I told you, you need to *lay on your back*--"

"S'*fine*, doc, I'll walk it off."

"Walk it--? You most certainly will *not!* Get your head back on that pillow or so help me I'll have you strapped *down,* Lieutenant."

"Jeez, leas' buy me dinner first--"

"Your survival is *critical* to troop morale. Imagine if Cormorant--" Egret swallows "--if some ill befell *her,* how long do you think it would take the for the whole front to collapse? Hm? Because you're nearly as important to the troops, the one thing keeping them from feeling quite so hideously outnumbered and outgunned as they are, and--"

I pull my blankets more tightly around me. The shivering is getting bad; I nearly bit into my tongue just now. "I lived, didn't I?" I mutter. "Egret, what in ash are you even doing at the front--"

"That. Is. Not. The. *Point!"* Egret practically shouts. She steps closer, unblinking eyes fixed on mine, her voice a low hiss. "Will you for *once* set your ego asi--"

"Mistress Silverdawn," the medic interjects acidly, "some *respect* for the wounded, if you would. The Commander--"

"--is a *professional,* *comrade*," Egret retorts without looking up. She aims a finger at my chest. *"This* is in any case entirely *self*-inflicted; bravery is worthy of respect but *do not conflate bravery with stupidity!*"

*"Comrade Silverdawn.* I understand you are close with the Cormorant but if you think that will stop me from having you thrown out of this facility--"

*"Sir!"* The door to the ward clatters open and an assistant bursts in, eyes wild. "Sir, orders from the General. We're to evacuate at once."

"Evacu--*what!?*" The medic is taken completely aback. "What are you--"

*"Den tsuang* just took the eastern gate. Sir, we have maybe ten minutes if we're lucky, they're advancing down the Causeway behind a wall of artillery. They'll have the whole Khmai Quarter under fire control soon--"

"God*dammit!*" The medic slams a fist against a support pillar. "That's not nearly enough time-- what are we--"

"Orders are, everyone too busted up to fight goes to the Witherbrook cargo depot by the underground. They're sending as many trams as they can spare but anyone who misses the transport at Witherbrook is going to be left facing the Guard advance."

"How are we supposed to get two hundred and twenty-nine *bedbound patients* onto a god damn rail car?"

"Don't you w-w-worry about me, doc," Sparrow calls out, trying to sit up again. "Get the others out, I'll help the rest buy you time--"

"You will do *nothing of the damn sort,* Fenwild!" I blurt, my lungs burning and my legs spasming involuntarily. "You're a g-goddamn combat liability right now and you are not going anywhere *near* the line of contact."

*"Thank you,"* the medic breathes, patting me on the arm. He points at Sparrow. "If you're this dead-set on being suicidally helpful then *help us get the patients to the underground."*

"If that's where I can do the most good--"

"It is. Go with Amaryllis and follow his instructions." The medic turns, glowering at Egret. "As for you, woman, get--"

"Sparrow." Egret turns away from the medic, as though he has simply ceased to exist. She beckons. "Help me with the stretcher."

"Just what do you think you're--" the medic bursts out. Sparrow looks hesitantly between the two of them.

Egret doesn't even look up as she replies, frantically buckling the straps over my shoulders, chest, and legs. "This woman is too important for me to trust you with her. *Sparrow!"*

'There is a *protocol,* Silverdawn--"

"And I wish you *best of luck with it,*" Egret growls, as Sparrow, wincing, takes hold of the top of my stretcher. "Now get out of our way!"

"Egret," I choke out, "don't, don't interfere--"

"You know the most unfair thing, Kestrel?" Egret asks, her voice uncharacteristically unsteady, and I whimper as my stretcher rises into the air. "If you die in action, *you don't have to explain yourself to her afterwards.*"

---

The last few years have been a contest of wills between the Ambassador and the Commander. My military instincts are too burned into my brain to fade on their own, and I figure the only way I'll ever be able to pass for a normal human being again is wrestling my past into submission. But I have to choose my battles, so today I don't waste willpower fighting my urge to lead from the front -- an urge that is no less strong in what is probably the most secure place on our little planet. *They might turn on us at any moment,* the Commander hisses in my head, but I slap her down with the the morning's memories. Little Nishuin alone could probably take me and Jay both with a hand tied behind her back if she had cause, and even Bear wouldn't last five seconds in a room full of Society ethnics. There is simply no preparing for a vanishingly improbable betrayal I have no means to mitigate in the slightest.

And all the same I'm the first to step into the room, reflexively casing it before I can get my brain back under control. A gentle breeze hits my face; one wall is open to the elements, and a translucent roof casts the wood paneling of the walls in warm daylight. Plants grow in recesses along the walls, and in the center of the room is a long, curved table wrapping a bit more than halfway around in a circle, with an odd curved slab of glass near the far edge rising out of the desk. In the middle of that circle is a rolling cart piled with what look like… wetsuits? Clearly some sort of garment, though not one I'm familiar with.

"Ambassador Kestrel. Honored comrades." The man standing in the center of the room offers a salute as we enter; I return the gesture almost reflexively. He's dressed in a long black _rancal_ with a white tail, like Soshten's uniform but pinned at the neck with a slim leather collar. "Please, make yourselves comfortable."

I offer Piper a chair before hesitantly seating myself. Nishuin takes up position beside but slightly behind the instructor, her hands clasped demurely at her waist. Part of me expects her to start unrolling a giant illuminated scroll with stroke diagrams, like I'm back in training again, and I feel a brief, ridiculous moment of *oh-no-I-forgot-my-brush-again* panic.

Hopefully diplomatic privilege extends to not being flogged in front of the class.

As we sit, the man in front of us bows deeply. "Welcome, all. I am Nalshan of the Sarsavi Ninth, instructor of space cadets at Tel Casran. I will be responsible for ensuring you achieve Green Sash proficiencies critical to space travel  such as microgravity navigation and shipboard safety procedure."

I incline my head. "Thank you, Nalshan-*surin*." I can't help but smirk at the startled look on his face. "It is a pleasure to meet you. Shall we go over names briefly for your sake?"

"I have previously familiarized myself with your staff," Nalshan says with a soft smile. "That will not be necessary."

"Ah!" I laugh awkwardly. "I keep forgetting we all have files. We are very grateful for your time and assistance, comrade."

"Think nothing of it." Nalshan waves dismissively, then clasps his hands behind his back. "Before we commence, I must give you a warning I am certain you have already heard here far too many times -- while I was selected by my superiors for my fluency in your common-tongue, my work has henceforth been exclusively among the People: I am a military planner, not a diplomat, and my knowledge of your culture is negligible. Thus I may not be as effective an instructor as I would wish, much as it shames me; I humbly ask that you forgive any unintentional offense or miscommunication on my part.

"For reasons of safety, your liaison Nishuin will of course be present during all sessions of this course; her role is to monitor and correct as necessary to ensure the language barrier does not lead to miscommuncation of critical procedure, and will co-certify your proficiencies at the end of this course.

"Now -- are there any questions regarding your upcoming course of study before we begin? "

Jay hesitantly raises a hand. Nalshan inclines his head to her. "Comrade Jay."

"Instructor Nalshan, sir." Poor Jay looks -- and sounds -- so painfully incongruous out of uniform. "What is the length of this course, sir?"

"That depends entirely on the students. Until you each are certified at Green Sash or higher, our regulations absolutely prohibit you from boarding any Society-sovereign spacecraft, absent emergencies requiring interplanetary evacuation." Nalshan's eyes twinkle. "In ordinary circumstances I would be entirely confident in my ability to raise you each to Green by the time the next starship arrives -- however, alas, you are foreign dignitaries, not cadets subject to military discipline, and this restrains me considerably."

"If I may, sir, I would request that you disregard—" Jay glances at me "—diplomatic niceties, as far as I am concerned. My job is keeping my Ambassador safe, and I would respectfully request that you treat me no differently than any ordinary cadet under your command."

Nalshan laughs. "Well! In that case I'm fairly certain you at least will easily meet the deadline." He glances at the rest of us. "Would any others care to join with Comrade Jay?"

"Bear and I will," I announce. "Please disregard any diplomatic privilege that might get in the way of doing your job. I will warn you if you cross a line; until then do not let our status trouble you." Jay gives me a respectfully exasperated look; I smile brightly back at her.

"You're passing as a civilian extra well today," Bear says in a low, amused whisper, pinching my thigh under the table.

"M-me too." I turn in surprise. Piper is holding up her hand hesitantly. Nalshan raises an eyebrow at the trembling waif, and glances around the room again. A few other hands grudgingly rise as well. I massage the bridge of my nose to hide a smirk.

*Wagbeak is going to* love *you, sweetheart.*

"Understood and noted." Nalshan nods approvingly. "I appreciate your dedication and the trust you're putting in me by voluntarily placing yourselves under military discipline. I will do my utmost to exceed your expectations. As for those of you who are not comfortable doing so, I hope you will not feel judged or diminished, as this is not a competition -- the optimal way to learn is generally the one you are most comfortable with. Nevertheless, I do respectfully ask that you keep your comrades in mind and dedicate yourselves seriously to the task at hand, to avoid any unnecessary flight delays or crew separation. —Comrade Bear, you have questions?"

"Could you give us a quick rundown of the curriculum?" Bear rumbles. "So we've some idea what to expect over the next moon or so."

"Of course! The first unit will be strictly ground-based. You will be outfitted with and trained in the operation of your safety gear, and any last-minute tailoring issues will be corrected." Nalshan indicates the garments on the cart. "Once you have acceptable proficiency in voidskin operation, we will begin easing you into orbital ascent, then microgravity. Once you are comfortable in a microgravity environment-- and getting to that point is a somewhat… intestinally traumatic experience, I regret to relate -- we will start on microgravity navigation techniques, protocol, and etiquette. Finally, you will learn how to respond rapidly to a variety of shipboard emergencies; the final test will involve patching a live hull breach and putting out a fire in orbit."

"A… live hull breach?" says Piper, eyes slightly unfocused.

"It is a very limited course, trimmed down to the absolute bare necessities," Nalshan replies. "Ordinarily I would never let anyone loose in space until they'd earned their red sash, and were proficient in micro- and variable-gravity combat, system and stellar comms, and emergency shift-drive operation. *However,* for reasons of security and simple relevance, the vast majority of course material will be omitted."

"Vast… *majority!?"*

"Additionally, as our training regimens are intended for military personnel, they ordinarily involve an element of low-level risk which diplomatic personnel certainly cannot be exposed to--"

"A live *hull breach?* That's not *risky!?*" babbles Piper. I lean over to put a hand on her back before she starts hyperventilating.

"Of course not!" Nalshan laughs. "Never fear. We tune our exercises to ensure— well, let me give you an example. What's your maximum PX? I imagine it's a bit low with your *uasdani* physiology but--"

"Maximum *what!?*"

"Ah, forgive my slang. I mean perceptual accel--"

"Instructor," says Nishuin softly.

Nalshan stops, and turns. "...was that, ah -- too intimate of a question?" he asks, reddening slightly.

"Nalshan-_surin_. At-will PX is not a capability found in baselines."

Nalshan blinks. He glances around the room. "And you're... all baselines? All of you? Ah, do forgive me if that is an inappropriate--"

"There is only one known non-baseline clade among the lawful Imperial population and it is vanishingly rare," Nishuin interrupts. "I would be surprised if there was so much as a single Rohara on this planet; there are certainly none in the room. Baseline perceptual acceleration is an involuntary response dependent on stress-activated neurotransmitters such as adrenaline; it is unpredictable, impossible to maintain for more than a brief period, harmful to the body, and even then they top out at arround factor six. I do not even know if they are able to operate at full intellectual capacity in that state, and they do not even have the physical strength to accelerate their movement along with their cognition. It is therefore *most* inadvisable to rely on their primitive PX mechanism in life-or-death matters."

Nalshan stares at her. *"Sixfold?* Are you serious?"

"Even that is uncommonly high."

Nalshan blinks several times. "I… I see. Clearly certain aspects of the training regimen will need to be… revised."

*"Thank you thank you thank you,"* I mouthe at Nishuin. God, her training wasn't completely useless after all! She smiles back at me.

Slowly, Nalshan turns back to us, looking slightly dazed. "I… hm. Breach drills are an absolute requirement for space travel, *but* we, ah, have a surgeon on staff who is a specialist in _uasdani_ physiology. I will consult with her and Nishuin-comrade to make entirely certain we conduct the drills in a manner that does not expose any of you to physical harm." He glances at me. "I… hope that is acceptable to you, Ambassador-comrade?"

"I will need to look over the specific plans for the drills myself," I answer. He nods, looking relieved.

"Of course. That will not be a problem. Ah, yes, Comrade Jay?"

"So, hypothetically, sir--" Jay tents her fingers absently. "If some of us were to complete… green level, yes? -- with enough time left over, would it be possible for those interested to receive some of that, uh… 'superfluous' training?"

"Oh!" Nalshan looks both surprised and happy. "Well! I… certainly could provide elective training in additional safety drills, though combat training is… mm, I would have to clear that with my superiors as that training is restricted material. It's not likely they'd assent, even to an ally — and, well, frankly, to be realistic with you, our courses are geared toward *randani* physiology, so I'm unsure to what extent you could safely—"

Jay holds up her hands. "If I may, sir. I'm interested in whatever other training you may be able to provide. If you can supply me with a list of what you're allowed to offer at some point, I would be very grateful. And as far as safety is concerned, I'll sign whatever waivers are necessary. Sir."

Nalshan looks helplessly at Nishuin. "W-waivers?" Nishuin sighs.

"A cognitive artifact of their former transactional economy. Under such systems duties of care and liabilities towards another may be discharged at the acquiescence of she to whom the care is owed. A waiver is the legal instrument which formalizes such an acquiescence; it is simply a specific kind of covenant." Nishuin turns to Jay. "Please forgive us, honored comrade. Under the Charter, consent is largely irrelevant to matters of responsibility, especially where grievous harm may result. Nalshan will be held responsible for your life and safety during void training regardless of what you may personally will. I realize this may be disappointing and perhaps insulting to you; I can only offer my deeply sincere apologies."

"…o-oh." Jay looks down. "I see. I apologize if I was out of line."

"You were not!" Nishuin assures her.

"Thank you for being so understanding and accomodating. I have no further questions, sir."

"I'll get you that list as soon as I can." Nalshan glances about the room. "Now, do any of you have pre-existing training in space safety protocol, microgravity combat, any other related proficiencies?"

"We don't have our own deepvoid assets yet," I interject quietly. "Right now the League is providing our system security under treaty; we ourselves are prioritizing reconstruction and planetside infrastructure deployment."

"Ah! I see. Please pardon my ignorance. But, in a way, this is all to the best," Nalshan adds. "Our training regime differs markedly from that of the various spacefaring League powers, due to both the technological gap between us and a more stringent adherence to procedure on our part. In this way, pre-existing proficiencies can be more of a hindrance than an asset." He clasps his hands. "Now, can anyone name the most important dangers void travel poses to human life? --Comrade Ash." He gestures to the Khmai boy.

"Decompression, suffocation, and radation, I believe sir. And slavers."

"In priority order no less! Very good, you only missed one: overheating. The void is a very rigorous environment that poses extreme challenges to the human body, and the baseline body most of all. In some ways it's actually more difficult just to keep people alive in the void than to travel between worlds in the first place. Obviously, that's the function of voidcraft, and after uncountable millennia of human void travel, we've gotten pretty good at it.

"However, even the best-designed voidcraft can't account for every eventuality. Who can tell me the primary function of voidship armor?"

"Surviving combat?" asks Bear suspiciously. Nalshan grins.

"In fact, no! That is actually only a secondary function. The primary function of ship armor is to protect the ship and its occupants against *debris.* The velocities you reach in the void are unlike anything you'll see planetside. A railgun round is slow by comparison to a cruising ship. And at those velocities, even small objects can cause a devastating impact. Interstellar probes that travel outside the hyperspace volume have to be coated with gigantic wedges of ice in the direction of travel, because relativistic velocity is so high that even a collision with a *particle of dust* could hit with the force of a bomb.

"Mercifully, travelling inhabited space requires much lower velocities thanks to shift drive. Spacefaring civilizations also develop networks of standard routes through their inhabited systems, establishing jump points and interplanetary lanes that are carefully monitored and kept clear of debris. However, even so, hull breaches *will* occur from time to time, particularly in old systems that have seen substantial warfare over the millennia. If you're very unfortunate you might even hit a live munition from a war than ended ten thousand years ago. This means that ultimately, the ship itself is sacrificial." He points to Ash and I. "Ultimately it's just a protective layer around the passengers -- around you. You can't count on the protections of the ship itself to keep you alive in all circumstances. Oxygen reclamation, heat reradiation, the hull and radiation shielding -- these can all fail in various ways.

"Now, consider those dangerous we just listed. Decompression, suffocation, overheating, radiation poisoning. These have something in common: outside extreme cases, none will be immediately lethal. You will have time to react, and potentially, if I do my job right, address the danger so it becomes survivable. However, that time can sometimes be measured in seconds, and you have to make every second count. Does anyone know how long an unprotected human baselines can survive direct exposure to hard vacuum?" He glances around. "Fifteen seconds. That's how long someone *else* has to rescue you, assuming you overcome your instincts and vent your lungs in time. You yourself will have only *seconds* to react before you lose consciousness. And if you *don't* vent your lungs, a sufficiently rapid drop in pressure will lead to internal ruptures that will leave you *unable to get oxygen from air* even if you are rescued -- at that point, the only way to keep you alive will be direct venous infusion of oxygen until you can be delivered to a red-level reconstruction center equipped to grow and implant new alveoli in your lungs. Or replace your lungs outright, if the damage is severe enough. That's not even getting into the severe damage that would occur to nonvital organs, like your eardrums. And there's no guarantee a baseline will even survive weeks or months of extracorporeal oxygenation.

"This is where voidskins come in." Nalshan touches the cart. "voidskins serve many different functions, but at their core, they're a fallback layer of armor between you and the void." He lifts up a suit, letting it unfold. It's made of a slick, black, reflective material, with the emblem of the Society on the upper arms and a sequence of glyphs above the breast. "When things go wrong in the void, this garment is what will keep you alive. Now, I want to be *very* clear, this is *not* a full hardplate. It can't deploy a helmet when pressure drops and it can't save you if you're sucked out into the void without one. The point of wearing a voidskin is simply to buy you time, whether that's to patch a hull breach, don an emergency helmet, get into your armor, or shoot some bastard dead. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you're automatically safe just because you're wearing one of these.

"The most important functionality of a voidskin day-to-day is its simplest: the rad barrier. There's a thin osmium-based metamaterial lining that limits your exposure to a wide spectrum of ionizing emissions, most particularly gamma rays and X-rays. Even if your trip goes exactly as planned, a small amount of ionizing radiation will still penetrate your ship's hull. A secondary layer that protects most of your body volume directly -- and we've done studies on this -- will dramatically decrease your chance of developing cancer and needing complicated, specialized medical treatment to root it out. The longer you spend in space, the more important it is to wear a voidskin at all times. Obviously it doesn't protect your head and brain below your neck, but those are a much smaller target, and among even long-term Society ship crew cerebral and oral cancers aren't much more common than lung cancer. Comrade Piper?"

"We have to wear those the whole time we're in space, sir?"

"That's correct, cadet."

Piper reddens slightly. "Can't we wear more… normal clothing?"

"Of course you can! You just have to wear it on top of your voidskin. In practice, though, most of our personnel eventually stop wearing anything but their suit when they're offworld; most ordinary clothing--" he touches his *rancal* for emphasis "--is very impractical in microgravity and in terms of heat redistribution. However, if it makes you feel more comfortable, you can absolutely wear your *rancal* on top; no one will make fun of you."

Piper bites her lip. "O-okay."

"In addition to the rad guard, your suit has many more sophisticated features." He taps the arm of the suit he's holding. "Every part of this suit is made of a smart material than can tighten and loosen in real time. Have any of you ever worn a flightsuit?"

Willow raises his hand. Nalshan nods to him. "What's the purpose of a flightsuit, Comrade Willow?"

"As I understand it, sir, it applies pressure to the extremities to prevent too much blood from flowing out of the brain and causing you to black out during high-G maneuvers."

"Absolutely correct, cadet. You can think of voidskins as similar, except they can react to your body and your acceleration in real time. Wearing one of these, you can endure dramatically higher acceleration while completely conscious. Now, ordinarily that kind of acceleration, you're only going to encounter that in combat, but -- well, I'm getting ahead of myself.

"The thing about the baseline body is it evolved, as far as we can tell, in a mid-grav environment. Your biology, and to a lesser extent mine, is dependent on gravity for a number of functions, and is 'calibrated' for a certain level of gravity depending on your race. Kaparttu, for instance, are less comfortable on higher-grav worlds than Zyahua. Now, void travel poses a problem because for much of the trip, you will either be in microgravity or accelerating at a lower G than your race is accustomed to." He holds up his arm, straining his sleek biceps so they bulge slightly up from his skin. "One of the biggest problems you'll face is muscle loss. You need far less muscle power to function and navigate in the void than you do on any planet, and your body *will* notice that. So given enough time it'll decide it doesn't need the muscles anymore and reabsorb them. Then you land on a planet and you're just crushed by gravity; you can barely lift your arms against it, let alone walk."

"Voidwalker disease, we call it," Bear murmurs.

"There are various countermeasures that can be applied. I understand in the Empire it's common for stations and the more expensive ships to have segments that rotate to provide artificial gravity. We consider this wasteful and use a more elegant solution." He lifts the arm of the suit. "Your suit is calibrated to your planet of origin and its gravity level. It contains resistive fibers, quite like muscles themselves, which react when you move a limb, and provide the appropriate level of resistance or assistance depending on your orientation. Most importantly it applies resistance to your chest, so that your lung muscles don't atrophy -- otherwise you might get home and suffocate when you try to lie down. Ah, Comrade Nishuin?"

"For the women among you, the suit also comfortably restrains your breasts to hold them in place regardless of your activity level," Nishuin interjects. "I understand this can prevent a great deal of pain for baselines. Additionally, living in low gravity is like routine use of supportive garments; it can cause your breasts to sag over time. Your voidskins will limit this as well by replicating the effects of gravity on your breasts to the greatest possible extent."

"Ah, interesting. Thank you, comrade." Nalshan turns back to us. "Additionally, the suits contain a venous interface system that can briefly supply emergency oxygen -- longer, with an external hookup -- and purge potentially lethal buildups of carbon dioxide, or other inert gases for that matter. This works by deploying micro-needles that pierce your skin and connect your veins to the filtration apparatus. --The winces are warranted, believe me; it's exactly as painful and unpleasant as it sounds, and once the needles have been deployed, you shouldn't try to remove your suit without a medic assisting you. But I promise you it's worth it -- if shipboard oxygen reclamation fails or the atmosphere is purged, your suit and helmet will, with enough power, keep you alive until the system can be repaired. voidskins are impermeable to gas, and the gloves -- which I encourage you to wear at all times and remove only when necessary -- form an airtight seal. If you already have your suit and gloves on, all you need to go is pull on a helm and you will be fully protected from both decompression and suffocation. And that only takes a second or two, compared to the thirty seconds or so it takes to suit up, even with practice.

"In order to help navigate in a microgravity environment, your suit has a number of strong electromagnets, in the feet, the hands, and down the back. For instance, you can activate the foot-magnets to let you walk along a metal surface, or set them in repulsor mode to push off from that same surface.

"Finally, there is the issue of overheating. voidskins use thermoelectric fabrics to purge heat from the body. Many cadets object to the prospect of wearing a skintight suit and gloves for extended periods because they worry it will make them hot and sweaty. In fact, your suit can be precisely adjusted to maintain the level of internal temperature you find most comfortable. You can even set different temperatures for different parts of your body. So don't worry about discomfort. I've found that many long-term ship crew actually get so used to this luxury they even wear their voidskins planetside. On their own, voidskins cannot radiate heat particularly effectively in a vacuum; however, their climate-control system integrates with hardsuit heat exchangers for EVA."

"Of course, there's a lot of extra functionality we've crammed into these things over the centuries, mostly convenience functions, but what I've described are the parts you need to know about and the parts you'll be trained and tested on. Keep in mind that most of these features are quite high-energy. Since most of you are significantly taller than than your typical *randanin* you actually have a bit of an advantage here; your suits have more room for battery polymer. On average, assuming no emergencies and minimal use of the magnav features, your suit's batteries should last about 32 hours, but you should always make sure you recharge it whenever you sleep. In all shipboard sleeping quarters, as well as your quarters here in the embassy, you'll find a dock by your bed with flex-fabric cuffs that are wired up to the ship's power grid. All you have to do to slip a cuff around your wrist and your suit will begin charging by induction. There are induction receptors on both wrists, ankles, and on the neck; you can use any one of these or even more than one at a time if you need to recharge your suit more quickly. Your suit will warn you with a painful jolt to the right wrist if the battery is running dangerously low. Do *not* let your batteries run out. It could very well cost you your life.

"Every day when you come to class I *will* check to make sure you remembered to recharge your suit overnight and you will be disciplined if you forget. Or, if you haven't consented to military discipline, I *will* shake my head and go 'tsk-tsk' at you in front of the whole class." He grins. "Alright. Hopefully by now I've convinced you that void travel is serious business, and not to take off your voidskin without a damned good reason."


"The consequence of this is that our volume is much emptier. There are vanishingly few stargates, no common routes, you're not likely to encounter any other voidcraft, and it's very, very unlikely that anyone will be able to respond in time if you launch a distress beacon. This means you need to take everything you might need on a journey with you -- things like medical equipment, redundant critical hardware, replacement parts, and so on. And most importantly: firepower.

"The emptiness of our volume means it's still 'wild.' You never know when you might encounter slavers or pirates. You can't protect yourself simply by 'sticking to the beaten path,' as there is none. You can only protect yourself by carrying a bigger gun than the other guy.

"This means, regrettably, we're going to have to talk about combat. Even though none of you will be involved in any aspect of combat unless, all fortune forfend, your ship is actually *boarded,* you still need to be prepared for combat procedures because they affect everyone onboard.

"Another vital purpose of your voidskin is to warn you of exceptional circumstances. The constrictor bands and electrodes will be provide a gentle, silent 'jolt' to your body, and most importantly can physically wake you up if you're asleep. Does anyone know why this is important? Comrade Ash."

"I assume you purge atmosphere before combat, sir?"

"Exactly so. The unfortunate thing about human physiology is we breathe glorified rocket fuel. A pressurized, oxygenated ship environment is great for comfort, but it's the absolute deadliest weakness when people are shooting at you. Any kind of hull puncture can cause rapid depressurization, which is deadly enough on its own, but there's something worse."

"Thermobarics," says Jay in a quiet voice, like someone who's just been shown a pile of corpses without warning. I flinch, realization dawning. Nishvir nods solemnly.

"That's it exactly. Thermobaric weapons are usually fired in the open salvo of any conflict between void-craft, especially if you can take the enemy by surprise. If you hit them before they've purged atmo, that's it, it's over. A wall of fire will gut their ship from the inside out. Only ships with separate atmosphere compartments stand a chance of surviving even one hit intact.

"So if your ship is attacked or combat seems to impend, ship atmosphere will be rapidly vented and drained to high-pressure storage tanks throughout the vessel. Without your suit to alert you and wake you up to don a helm, you would likely suffocate in your sleep -- it's impossible to sustain consciousness below a certain level of pressure. Depending on your phase of sleep the ship's sonic alarms *might* be able to wake you in time, but an electric jolt to the nerves will wake you from anything short of a coma."



"Well, enough talking. It's time for you to actually learn how to don and remove your voidskins." Nalshan clasps his hands. "Please disrobe and--"

Nishuin actually grabs him by the shoulder, eyes wide with alarm. "Comrade, that is not advisable," she blurts, holding up a hand to us in a placating gesture. Nalshan blinks.

"Forgive me, what is the matter?"

"The Imperial cultures have a very strong taboo on interpersonal nudity. This was… an issue, yesterday."

"An 'issue?'"

"We are fortunate not to have caused a diplomatic incident."

Nalshan's eyes widen. "Well. Hm. That presents a problem -- Ambassador, I assume requiring your staff to undress as a group would be, as you say, 'crossing a line?'"

"Yes," I reply immediately. "Very much so."

"Perhaps -- hm. *We've* no objection to nudity, so perhaps a demonstration would suffice, and your people could then dress themselves privately -- Comrade Nishuin, could I enlist you briefly?"

"Of course! It would be my pleasure to be of use. I'll fetch my suit directly…" Nishuin turns, then hesitates and turns back to me. "Hm. Comrade Ambassador, forgive me for again touching on such a sensitive topic, but your culture's nudity taboo -- is it a matter of discomfort with your own nudity, or do you feel uncomfortable in the presence of others who are nude as well?"

"Raise your hand if you object to seeing Comrade Nishuin naked," I call out. Bear bursts out laughing. Piper immediately blushes and Jay flashes Nishuin an over-the-top sleazy grin. No one puts up their hand. "You have your answer, comrade," I tell the girl.

"Oh, good!" exclaims Nishuin, clasping her hands. "I do so appreciate your tolerance. I shall return momentarily."

"She is so innocent," Bear murmurs to me. "It's adorable."

"Ma'am, what's our embassy policy on catcalling our hosts?" Jay asks me as Nishuin slips out of the room.

I can't suppress a little laugh. "Hold off until our cultural attaché gets me a report on the topic."

"Copy that, ma'am." Jay touches her brow. Bear rumbles with laughter, nudging me with an elbow.

"Aren't you your own cultural attaché at this point, *Kestrel-*_surin_?"

"I've got leave *something* for poor Piper to cut her teeth on."

Nalshan clears his throat. "Now that you mention it -- since I cannot discuss course material until our Liaison returns, perhaps we can take advantage of this downtime for some casual discussion, sate one another's curiosity somewhat. How does that sound?"

"Well, I've got something I'm curious about," says Bear after a moment. "If these void-suit things are so fancy, why do you only wear them in space? If I had my own personal climate control I could just carry around with me, I don't think I'd ever want to put it down."

"'voidskin' is a bit of an archaism, I suppose," replies Nalshan. "Keeping void travellers safe was the original purpose of the design, but it has been so expanded and streamlined and so many new capabilities added that the garment has become useful planetside as well. To answer your question, many of us do make casual use of voidskins; they are common wear on particularly hot or cold days, and are very often worn for extra protection when camping in wild regions. Particularly in the Colonies, as they are much wilder and more sparsely populated. They are also useful when swimming for extended periods or in dangerously cold waters, and they are of course a standard part of fighter pilot duty dress. 

"However, the *rancal* remains our preferred form of clothing, for most. Partly as a matter of tradition, partly because we tend to prefer lighter, less concealing garments. voidskins cover the body in a way that hampers intimacy and dulls exterior sensations. Wind and rain on our bodies, the heat of the sun, and so forth. We prefer not to be cut off from nature when it is not necessary.


"I'm going to hand out your suits and your wrist consoles. Keep in mind, voidskins are tailored from the ground up to a specific individual and are *never* interchangeable -- this is part of why it's mandatory to wear yours at all times; we can't just stock emergency kits with them. Wristcons are completely interchangeable and if yours is damaged, you can just swap it out for a functional one."



"Is there really…" Piper's cheeks are beet red. "This is *really* tight, couldn't I get something that fits, y'know, a little better? Sir?"

"This *is* a perfect fit for a voidskin, cadet," Nalshan replies. "In order to be able to function properly it needs to provide a certain minimum level of pressure uniformly across the body. Otherwise the sensory electrodes can't make contact, the filtration system wouldn't be able to access your veins, the resistance fibers would be useless, and your skin would inflate like a balloon the moment you were exposed to vacuum. Thanks to a certain training accident a few years ago I'm privileged to be able to tell you from firsthand experience, you do not *ever* want to find out what *that* feels like."

Piper's gaze drops. "O-oh. I, um. Okay, sir," she mumbles, squeezing her legs tightly together. "Can we take them off now?"

"I'll show you how to remove them shortly, but as part of your training, you are all required -- or in the case of those of you who have not assented to military discipline, politely requested -- for your own safety to wear your suit at all times from this point forward. Every day I'll get a data dump from your suits and if I spot any miscalibrations, I'll adjust them until we get it right. You need to be accustomed to it by the time we head into orbit, and more importantly we also need to collect a few weeks of baseline biodata on you. We need to make sure your suit's synced properly with your body as well, since none of you have Society health, genetic, and biomorphology records to work from . The suit may feel awkward now, but I promise in a week or two you'll feel naked without it."

Piper looks like she's going to melt from pure embarassment.



"Back on Tel Casran your subordinate would have been flogged in front of the class for that," he observes wrily as my crew files out of the room.

I fold my arms and narrow my eyes. "…I'll allow it," I say after a moment, raising a finger before Nalshan can interject. *"If* they ask nicely first."

Nalshan laughs out loud. "Ambassador. It really is a pity we've only so long to get to know each other."

"Hey now, don't say that," I reply archly. "Surely we've got a few years yet before you manage to certify me."

Nalshan smiles politely. "Fear not, comrade; I have little doubt I'll whip you into shape with time to spare."

"Fair warning. I was held back three whole years at the scribal academy when I was a teenager."

Nalshan moves to look me directly in the eye, and claps a hand to my shoulder. He's rather tall for a Randani, I note. "Challenge accepted, cadet," he says, eyebrows rising and the corner of his lip curling upward. "I hope you have a marvelous afternoon."

"And you." I touch him lightly on the shoulder and bow. "Forgive me. I'd curtsey, but my dress was deemed a national security hazard."

Nalshan nods, deadpan. "Then our nuclear secrets are safe… for now."

I pause on my way out the door, and turn back to him. "Tell me something?"

"Of course."

"Nuclear secrets. Are those really still the most important secrets you've got? At your level, I mean?"

Nalshan laughs. "Oh, Ambassador. Answers like that are *well* above my clearance."

I grin. "I had a feeling. See you around, Comrade."

"Please, Ambassador. *Nal* is perfectly fine in the, hm, 'personal context', perhaps?" His eyes twinkle mischievously. "Or *sir* -- whichever makes you more… comfortable."

I raise my eyebrows. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind." I flash him a casual salute. "See you around -- sir."


Eventually Jay and I are the last ones left in the tranquil little garden, staring up at the moons. A constant in the night sky my whole life -- it's unsettling to think I won't see them for at least four years of my life.

"You are really serious about protecting me, hey?" I ask Jay softly after a while.

"Ma'am." She doesn't quite stand to attention this time, but I can tell she's fighting her instincts. "If I may, ma'am -- if there is any microgravity combat experience to be found in the Republic, it's among private citizens who've sailed the Void. Mercenaries, relic hunters, adventurers, pirates and slaver scum who've escaped justice, and so on. As things stand our military is in no position to offfer that training -- right now we don't even have a practice platform -- and that means we're behind not only probably the whole damn League but the *den tsuang* as well. I am *deadly* serious about protecting you, ma'am, but I also feel it is urgent to transmit whatever skill and experience I can acquire in this new battlespace to our military so we can get a head start at catching up. Being able to both board and repel is crucial in Void combat, sometimes more so than your own ride surviving the engagement."

I rub my brow tiredly.  A golden new world on the horizon and all she can think of is killing people there. I really want to slap her, if I'm being honest with myself.

But I also know everything she just said made perfect sense and I agree with her assessment in every particular. Probably that's *why* I want to slap her so much.

…I really need to talk to Shalvan about this.

I pat Jay on the shoulder. "Ever the consummate professional, soldier," I tell her.

"Ma'am." A little flicker of a smile at what she apparently interpreted as a compliment.

"Tell me something." I fold my arms, gazing into her eyes. "What do you think of the League? --And yes, before you ask, please, speak freely. Always, when we're one on one."

"Well, ma'am." Jay chews her lip for a moment. "We couldn't have done it without them, ma'am, and I am deeply and profoundly grateful for what they did for our people, and I respect the hell out of them, and I don't trust them as far as I could throw their capital star system. Ma'am."

I laugh weakly. 


"And Jay?"

"Ma'am?"

"I'm your Ambassador, not your CO. Military courtesy is really not necessary--"

"With respect, ma'am--"

"Jay, if you're saying it to my face, I already know you mean it with respect--"

"--you are an ambassador but you are also General-for-Life of the Army. I served in and remain on reserve in that same Army and you outrank virtually everyone else in my chain of command, so I do think--"

"You know that job is just a sinecure, right? I'm not *in* your chain of command, because I don't *have* a command--"

Jay looks at me with an expression usually directed far down the business end of the chain. "Ma'am," she says tiredly, "if you gave the order to jump, can you think of a single officer, noncom, or recruit in the Army, Navy, or Air Force who wouldn't salute and ask 'how high?' with a dopey grin on their face?"

"Khata'e's tits, Jay, I'm not the commander-in-chief--"

"I understand that's a topic of some contention. For what it's worth--" Jay fixes me with an look that makes my subconscious *really confused* about who outranks who here "--as far as I'm concerned, Silverd--"

"Lieu*tenant!"* I snap. Jay immediately stands to attention. "For the love of God within do *not* finish that sentence. This is a secure facility but it's not *our* 'secure.' Do you understand?"

Jay takes a sharp breath, finally realizing what she was just about to do. "Ma'am! Yes, ma'am; I apologize, General; it will *not* happen again."

"See that it doesn't, soldier." I pat her on the shoulder, and as I walk past, I lean closer. "I appreciate the sentiment all the same," I whisper with a wink. Jay cracks the tiniest grin.

"Understood, ma'am."

I hold out until my cabin door clicks shut behind me. Slowly I sink to the floor, back pressed against the door, fingers fumbling for a pouch of cigarettes that isn't there. I'm shivering at first, then shaking, and then my chest is spasming and I'm doubled up, my whole body quivering from the force of my silent sobs.

By the time I manage to unclench my fist there's red marks under my calluses and blood caked under my nails.

The last time I had to do that was the day I got Sparrow her White Stripe. And I was angry then, full of adrenaline and righteous fire, and not so far off from the old days. And I had time to psych myself up first. It still hurt, obviously it still hurt, throwing that bloodsoaked old raiment upon my soul again after how deep I fought to bury it, but that time it was like a flesh wound. Barely a papercut to the inner Spark.

This time it was a knife in the gut.

I sit there for a good long while, staring blankly at the handset on the table, easily the most unfamiliar thing in the room. Inside it's quiet and clear but for what feels like the distant thumping of artillery fire, threatening to get closer if I think about anything, anything at all, if I so much as *move* and my old wounds flare up again. I feel so *dirty* I could scrub and scrub for hours and I still wouldn't feel clean, dirty *under my skin*. And I don't know how much time actually passes before I finally reach up and wrap my unsteady hand around the receiver and pull it down to my lips.

It's silent for a moment, then I hear a clatter, heavy breathing, and-- "Ambassador? Comrade, is all well?"

I stare at the soft, meaningless green symbols on the handset's light-up panel.

"Ambassador? Comrade Kestrel, please come in--"

"Soshten." I whisper. My throat hurts so bad I can barely get it out without whimpering.

"Er, no, comrade, this is Nishuin, the line goes directly to my--"

"Soshten," I reply softly. "Please. Please just. Get her."

"…Comrade? I don't, er--"

"Please." I can't hold back the whimper that time, and there's obvious alarm in Nishuin's voice when she replies.

"I-- yes, of course, at once, Ambassador. Er, that would be Comrade Soshten Mirvasi, yes?"

"Y-yeah."

"I will relay your summons. Is there anything else--"

The receiver slips from my fingers and clatters to the ground. I slump back against the door, burying my head in my knees and wrapping my arms tight around the back of my head and neck.

The next thing I register is soft hands on my body. Footsteps, voices, light. For once, I don't lash out. I'm not sure I could make myself. I feel like I did that morning in the barracks when I was still a nameless grunt, the day before we shipped out to Shattercrest -- except, I suppose, with none of the residual afterglow.

I blink, again and again until the tears have cleared enough that I can see. 

Soshten is sitting above me. She's in her… underwear, I guess, a soft, tight black wrap around her breasts, and another around her thighs. The sight is enough to immediately recenter my attention. I'm splayed out on my bed, I realize. Soshi is hunched beside me, one arm tight around her legs, softly stroking my abs with her free hand. As my eyes begin to focus she starts, leaning closer.

"Kess?" she murmurs. She's trying to hide the fear in her voice but it keeps cracking and wobbling, and the redness of her eyes says plain that she's been crying.

God within I am such a selfish dick.

"I… I gave you a dose of your medication." She gropes for her handset. "Shalvan's holding for you if… if there's anything… I haven't told anyone else, I haven't told Nishuin -- should I get Bear or--?"

I curl up closer to her, my head pressed tight against her thigh. She stops, and wraps her arms around me tightly, softly stroking my back. Her soft, perfect skin against mine, her lips on my forehead, the gentle rhythm of her pets are enough that my breathing starts to calm.

"Kess? Please just. Please just say something. Kess, I'm scared--"

"I'm sorry," I whisper, throat raw, voice husky and cracked. I feel like I've been crying a lot harder than I remember.

"What happened? Stars and skies, who did this to you--"

I shake my head.


"You know, I heard the most *interesting* rumor this afternoon." A smirk is tugging at Soshten's lips.

"Do tell?"

"I heard that a certain foreign dignitary has been flirting with our handsome young "

"Iiiii would not know anything about that," I reply, my gaze slipping away as my cheeks start burning.



Soshten grins. "These suits are crammed with sensors and effectors, and we've had this tech for centuries now. People have written all kinds of software for them."

My cheeks are burning and I'm stammering as I start to realize the implications. Only then do I realize. "You're… telling me you managed to fit a *computer* in here?" I stare at her, poking at the thin fabric, and giving myself an unintentional jolt to the arm. "No. No way. I do not believe you. That's not even possible--"

Soshten just laughs at me. "There's a ton of redundant networked processors spread throughout the suit so getting shot in the wrong place doesn't take the whole thing offline. We can make CPUs thinner than that, Kess. And that's not even getting into what the Echoes -- agh, sorry, I mean the Thalisans -- can do. I've heard their processors can't even be seen with the naked eye."

'No *way*. I know better than to believe the stories people make up about the Shadows. You're just messing with me."

"Am not. *Think,* Kess, how could we pack all that functionality into those suits without onboard processors?" There's an evil gleam in her eye now. "If you don't believe me I can prove it to you. Let me just go get a laptop and I'll write a new program for it here and now--"

I shrink back towards the pillow. "Okay, okay, I believe you, you don't have to threaten me!"

"Aren't you just a *little* bit curious what I have in store for you?"

"How do I take away your access again?"

She just grins and strokes my inner thigh, making me yelp at the sudden, tingling galvanic current. "Gosh, I'm getting all kinds of evil ideas now. I could just leave this program on and you'd never figure out how to turn it off--"

Immediately I touch my back and make the "unseal" gesture with my right hand. Thank God, it works perfectly this time, and the small indentation down the back splits neatly in two. Soshten pouts as I pull the suit off; I roll it up and throw it at her.

"Spoilsport." I blink. She's very suddenly holding the suit neatly folded. I didn't even see her move, not even a blur. She sets it on the corner of the bed, hooking up the power leads.

"Like I'm going to give you a chance to lock that thing on me," I return.

"Ooh, now there's an idea." She straddles me, pushing me down flat on the bed and kissing me tenderly on the lips. "Maybe next time~"

*"Agh."* I squirm as she presses a knee forcefully up between my thighs.

"For the record," she murmurs, taking my wrists in her hands and pinning me down, staring unblinking into my eyes, "there is *nothing* you can actually stop me from doing to you." She giggles at the expression on my face. "If I wanted to force that thing back on you right now, *believe you me* I could do it." For a moment it's like tight iron manacles a size too small are painfully squeezing my wrists and her eyes are burning into mine, but then she releases me. "Stars and skies you're so cute when you're scared," she observes, laying on her side and idly massaging my breast with her right hand.

I sigh, trying to make myself relax. "You were just bullshitting me, weren't you."

"What? No, no, not at all. I really could. Want me to show you?"

*"No* thank you," I lie.

"Tch. You're so tense. I'm sorry, I'll stop teasing you, I can tell I'm just making it worse." She pats me on the shoulder. "C'mon, turn over. I'll rub your back 'til it's better."

I sigh. "I haven't been able to properly relax without a good strong bottle of gin in years."

"Challenge accepted. Turn over or I'll *make* you."

"Okay, okay." I flop over and she straddles me again, kissing me softly on the back of the neck.

"You know," she comments playfully, "there's a suit program for this--"

*"No."*

"The constrictors and galvanic effectors are actually *really good* for massage. Best part is you can just leave it on as long as you want."

"Soshi."

"Imagine getting a nice, full-body massage all the way through some long, boring meeting. Wouldn't that be nice? A few hours of that and all that stress and strain will just float away, I'll bet you."

I feel my cheeks starting to heat up again. "I-- I think that would be *really* embarassing."

"What? Why? I don't think anyone would notice--"

"They would notice when I started *blushing and gasping and moaning,* Soshi."

"But that's part of the fun, keeping your reactions under control." She takes me by the shoulders, squeezing and rubbing expertly, and I sigh quietly. The physical pleasure of her forceful touch feels even better than the fake _sèing_ they gave me. Something to keep in mind if I start craving the evil stuff.

"Uh, I don't think I physically *could.*"

She snickers. "What kind of training were they even giving you? If you couldn't keep such a basic level of discipline--"

"Basic level--" I laugh unsteadily. "Where I come from, 'discipline' means 'obeying orders and not mouthing off at your superiors too much'. I don't think I saw anyone so much as stand to attention for the first year of our fight."

"If you can't even control your reaction to pleasurable stimulus, how are you ever going to cope with pain? One little cry at the wrong moment can give away your position. Someone who can't control their reactions is *dangerous* if you don't want a nice little airstrike right on top of your sniper's nest."

"So, what, Society basic trains you to keep quiet in bed?"

I can't see her face but her voice is deadly serious. "Self-control is important, Kess. *Especially* for us. Men have it easy, their bodies don't fight them every step of the way when they try to be all stoic. Y'know, there's actually a party game we play sometimes where you just work someone over to try and get a noise out of them, see how long they can hold out. It's really fun, it's *so* satisfying to take some cute girl who thinks she's tough and just *break* her, take away all of her self-control bit by bit. *Especially* when the rest of her unit is watching. Good practice, too." She presses her thumbs *hard* into my shoulder muscles and I gasp heavily, trying to pull away from the intolerable sensation. She doesn't relent until I'm a writhing mess, giggling uncontrollably and begging her to stop. "You wouldn't last two seconds," she observes as she finally lets up.

"Are all your games th-that cruel?" Panting, I clutch a pillow like it'll somehow protect me.

"All the most fun ones. I managed to last two whole *minutes* with my CO a couple years ago, and he's *brutal*." She shivers, letting out a happy sigh. "I don't think anyone else in my unit came close."

"Con... gratulations?"

"Thanks!"

I gaze out the window. My back twinges as I reorient myself, and a thought occurs.

"Hey, Soshi?"

"Yeah, hon?"

*'Hon' already?* "The suit restrictors… they can operate in reverse, right?"

"Yeah, we use those to help cope with higher-grav worlds when there isn't time to adapt our bodies. Guess for baselines it'd be pretty good for combat too. Why do you ask?"

I lean back, nestling into the pillows. "One of my last ops before the end of the war… fuck, it was stupid. There was a noble we were sent to grab, as a hostage to get her family to surrender. It was like taking *bai due* from a *pien şai,* I don't even know why they wasted the Ninth on that op; blackops trainees could have done it without supervision and it would have gone off without a hitch." I sigh. *"Almost* without a hitch. Security was armed with frag grenades, and when they forced us out of cover -- I swear, I didn't even feel anything until the op was done, but apparently some shrapnel sliced right through my armor when I was diving. Thank God it just grazed me, but--" I tap my lower back "--it was close enough to tear right through a muscle and some nerves."

"Oh! That's awful. I'm so sorry."

"I guess the damage was just too extensive for my body to heal. Even after years of physical therapy it's hard to sit up. Hurts like hell too and no matter how much I exercise it doesn't get any easier, after a point."

"Why haven't you gotten it fixed--" Soshten stops, slightly dropping her head. "Don't tell me. You don't have the medical tech."

"I... didn't know there was medical tech *could* fix an injury like that," I murmur.

"Of course there is. Kess, we can replace whole *bodies* from a stem cell culture if we have to; of course we can repair a little muscle damage. We'll get that fixed up for you on Tel Casran." She pauses, clasps her hands awkwardly. "If you... trust us to work on you,that is."

"You..." I whisper, stunned. "You would... you'd seriously?"

She glares at me. "Kestrel Winterblossom what part of *comrades* do you not understand? Of course we'll help our allies. We do this all the time."

"How much would it--" I begin, but catch myself. "--ignore that, please."

She laughs out loud. "Were you seriously about to ask how much it would cost?"

"Old habits die *real* hard, Soshi."

"All you have to do is ask, sweetheart. There might be a bit of a wait -- some of the more specialized procedures can only be done on Tel Casran, especially the ones for *uasdannen,* and it's first-come, first serve unless triage says otherwise -- but it's not gonna *cost* you anything."

"That's... wow." I take a deep breath. "I thought... I thought I'd be living with this for the rest of my life."

"Nope! Also, good thought on the suit. It should definitely be able to compensate for your muscle weakness."

"Can you…?"

"I can try. Really this is something you need a medic to do, but since you don't need to be combat-ready I can hack together a little patch to tide you over for the moment." She gives me a flirty little smile. "We can go to the medic together when I'm off duty this evening."

"God, please. Thank you so much. That sounds amazing."


"Anything else you want me to set up for you?" She idly taps a key and I can't help but yelp at the sudden pressure against my clitoris. "Say, a bit of… sporadic encouragement?"

"You *turn that off* or I swear by God within I will *find* some way to hurt you." I squeeze my thighs together but it does nothing to affect the pulses of pressure. I bury my burning cheeks in a pillow.

She giggles. "You're *fun,* Kess." I let out a quiet gasp as the pressure momentarily intensifies, but then slackens off. "I guess I'll have mercy on you... *this time*."

*New mission, top priority: get Nalshan to invalidate her login for me -- civilian casualties acceptable.*

*"Thank you,"* I mutter. I squeeze the pillow between my thighs, breathing deeply, and look back up. "And no, I think you're up in my personal space enough already. You wanna touch me inappropriately, use your damn hands to do it."

Soshten snickers. "Alright, alright. Stand for me; I gotta get some recordings."

Reluctantly, I turn and lower my feet to the floor. "This better not be a trick to get me to show off my ass."

"Kess, you wound me! As if I would neglect your beautiful tits." She beckons. "C'mon. I swear on my honor I'm not messing with you."

"You just called my tits 'beautiful,' you are obviously messing with me."

"What? What makes you say that?" She sounds genuinely puzzled.

"Soshi. My chest is *tiny.* I could actually fight without my chestguard in a pinch; even sprinting and rolling for cover only hurt a little."

Again, *the look.* "What does size have to do with anything? You're really well proportioned, you have a great silhouette, and they bounce just enough to be sexy without going all over the place and making you look silly." She swats my breast lightly. "If anything, bigger tits would ruin your look. You're pretty average-sized, anyway."

"Average?" I poke her chest in retaliation. "I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but we are *both* so small it's hard to find protective wear in our sizes."

"Okay, average by *my* standards. Many Zyahua women look odd to me. I thought it was some kind of cosmetic surgery fad at first."

"That's average for you?" I pat her on the head. "Is that because you're so tiny?"

She takes my hand, holds it to her breast, makes me squeeze gently. I blush softly, her breast warm and firm beneath the thin fabric of her *rancal;* her heartbeat pulses in my fingers. "This is a comfort- and combat-optimized breast, carefully selected for over hundreds of years," she says, sounding almost *proud.* "We only need chest protection for the most strenuous activities. I could suckle a baby while dodging gunshots and I'd be perfectly comfortable. Not that I would ever do such an insane thing," she adds quickly.

"…that is so weird."

"It was just an example."

"No, I mean…" I shake my head. "You talk about *yourself* the way engineers talk about their machines."

"Well, we *are* engineered. These bodies are our own design, made for living life to the fullest. "

"And killing life to the fullest."

"Also that!" She doesn't even seem to notice the barb, just grinning that infectious grin of hers. "We are in all ways markedly superior to the People of five generations ago, and the People five generations to come will, if fate allows, be even further superior to us."

"Doesn't that... bother you?"

"Bother me?" She laughs. "It excites me! After all we've accomplished in a thousand years, I cannot even imagine what we will be like in another thousand. All I know is that every generation will be better off than the last, and that's wonderful. Wouldn't you want your children to have better lives than you did?"

"Yes," I blurt. *"Obviously."*

"There you go then. We reach eternally toward perfection, and it is glorious to behold." She pats my rear. "Just like your ass. Now c'mon. I need recordings."

"What do you need me to do?"

"Basically? Do whatever hurts the most."

I wince. "Great."

"No pain, no gain, babe." She winks at me.

I move through a few different poses, straining my back muscles as much as I dare. Normally I'm cautious with them, relying on my arms and my surroundings for leverage to lessen the blow, but that's not an option now, and it's agonizing, especially performing all these moves after another. "This was a bad idea," I mutter as I collapse to my cot.

"Why's that?"

"I have *things* to do to today. *Walking around* things. I'm going to ache for hours at this rate."

"Your *shanvol* meds are an exorphine blend, hon. Just take a dose, it'll knock the pain out." She cracks her knuckles, and starts tapping away on the keyboard. "Can you lay down flat, then sit up slowly? I need a clean nerve recording."

"Ugh, fine. What do you mean, a nerve recording?"

"The way the restrictors work is they use the electro-mesh to monitor impulses to your muscles. That way they can work in real time, instead of having to forecast from the propriosensors. Basically, it links up right into your body the way a limb would."

"…wow. Can you, like… make machines that work like a limb? Like, your soul-- or, um, your brain, I guess -- just pushes it around direct instead of going through a control panel?"

"Yes! It's tricky though. You need this band on your head just above your ears to pick up the brainwaves, and then you have to train with the machine for a while to get it synced to your unique soul. If you want full sensory integration that's gonna take surgery, maybe brain surgery, and that's only really worth it for prosthetics. Our ID implants have some basic feedback functionality built in these days, though." She taps the back of her neck.

"Damn. That's… impressive."

"Thanks!"

"Have you ever used anything like that?"

"Yeah, I did the sync training with my hardsuit. It's pretty new tech and kind of experimental, so most people are still using the on-glove contacts for armor control. But thought-control is so intense, I can just operate on instinct and I'm probably a lot more effective than someone using the old-style interface. I bet I could take on ten *vitiular* like that and rip them apart. Man, what an edge that would have been in the War!"

"'Vits… _vitiular_'?"

"Your pronunciation is getting better already! Sorry, that's our name for -- I think you called them the _den tsuang,_ the Imperial Guard."

"You're kidding me. Ten of those bitches, at once?"

"I mean, I won't know for sure until I've tried. But I bet I could."

I look down. "I would give a *lot* to watch that," I mutter bitterly. She laughs.

"Don't tempt fate, babe."

"Yeah. Right. I should know better than that."

She strikes a contact on the laptop with a triumphant flourish. "Try now. The new patch should be active."

Hesitantly, I sit up, instinctively expecting my back to flare up again. It's still hurting from earlier, but to my astonishment, I find myself sitting up with almost no effort at all. It's like when you gently push a door shut and you've forgotten you left a window open, and the thing just slams so hard you jump. Experimentally I stand, bending this way and that, trying to adjust to the new ease of movement.

"Soshi," I whisper, staring at her.

"How's it work? Is it--"

I reach up with a quivering hand to wipe away the tears trickling from my eye. "Thank you. Thank you, thank you, *thank you--"*

"So, it's working then?"

"Soshi, this is amazing. I feel… oh, my God. I haven't felt this whole in so long." My gaze drops to my feet, my cheeks hot. "I think I could dance again," I whisper.

Soshten claps her hands in triumph. _"Sav valari cite!_ Wow, Kess, you look-- I don't think you looked this happy even after I was through with you last night, and you were *so* pent up--"

The tears are streaming uncontrollably now and I give up on wiping my eyes. Experimentally I trace out a few steps of an old folk dance Sparrow taught me all those years ago. I feel so *light."*

I turn and tug Soshten to her feet. She clasps her hands demurely behind her back, gazing up at me flirtatiously, and I pull her close, hugging her so tightly I might actually have hurt her if she was a baseline. "Thank you," I whisper again, and she laughs happily, stroking my back. The voidskin is thin and tight enough that the touch still feels intensely intimate, even if I can't feel just how soft her skin is on mine. A little galvanic frisson follows her touch. It's strong enough to tingle and make me shiver, but not enough to hurt.

"Don't get too excited," she tells me. "This is really something that should be done by a medic, so don't go crazy until he's had a chance to clean up my mess, okay?"

"Okay."

I had expected to feel something pushing against me like a helping hand when I worked the damaged muscles, but it really feels completely seamless. I could easily forget that the suit was helping me at all.

Well, now I have a really good reason not to take it off any time soon.

She kisses me, slipping a knee between my thighs and patting my rear. "I really gotta get to work, babe," she murmurs, squeezing me tight. I rub the back of her neck, wrap an arm around her waist.

"Okay," I whisper again, resting my forehead against hers.

"I'll come by when I'm off duty and take you to the medic, alright?"

"Alright."

She steps back, holding me by the shoulders, backing onto the step by the doorway so our eyes are level. "I think I love you, Kess," she says. And before I can recover enough presence of mind to respond, she's gone, the door closing softly behind her.

I'm still blushing stupidly when I arrive at Nalshan's little conference room. He looks up, surprised, when I enter.

"Ambassador. Welcome; I wasn't expecting you yet."

"Shouldn't you be calling me 'cadet'?" I tease him.

"Indeed," he says, glancing at the inscrutable clock, "in about two minutes or so."

"I was hoping you could help me with a problem, so I came early."

"I'm happy to help. Suit giving you trouble?"

I purse my lips. "If, um. I let someone else authorize themselves so they can program my suit -- how do I revoke that authorization again?"

Nalshan looks up from his slate, an amused look on his features. "You did *what?* I never showed you how to do that."

"She kind of let herself in."

"What in Haven possessed you to allow such a thing?"

I squeeze my wrist awkwardly. "She... talked me into it. In retrospect I don't know what I was thinking."

"Hmm." Nalshan folds his arms. "I'm very sorry, Ambassador, but I do not think I can assist you in this matter."

"Wh-what? Why not?"

"Firstly, your decision was a grievous security lapse. Ordinarily that would be cause for corporal punishment, but I think in this case a more suitable punishment would be for you to live with the consequences of your decision." He raises a hand as I start to open my mouth. "Careful, comrade. You have approximately 20 seconds until you're mouthing off to a superior officer. Now, *additionally,* the level of power over your body you've given away, I think that's actually an excellent trust-building exercise that will in time help you open up to Comrade Soshten and let your guard down around her."

I narrow my eyes. *"I never said her name."*

"…really?" Nalshan falters. "That's so strange, I could have sworn you said--"

"I said *nothing of the kind.*" I fold my arms, glaring at the instructor. "Are you *conspiring* behind my back?"

Nalshan holds up a finger, pointing at the clock. "'Are you conspiring behind my back, *sir*'."

"…sir," I murmur, reddening. He smirks.

"That will be all, cadet. If you would take your seat."


The medic scans through the complicated flow chart, expanding and collapsing various boxes and emitting the occasional word that sounds like it's probably a curse, especially judging from how Soshten looks a little bit more humiliated each time.

"I think," he says finally, turning back to me, "I will have to excise this entire patch and program a new one around the physio-neuro profile data."

Soshten cringes. "It was that bad?"

"We have standard techniques and templates for this form of treatment which are designed to work seamlessly across a wide variety of combat, utility, and therapeutic smartwear, and they have been tested, deployed, and refined over *hundreds of years*, comrade," says the medic, folding his arms. "There is no point in trying to salvage this… arcane contraption of clumsily reinvented wheels glued together with neutron-degenerate conditionals and *desperate prayers to uncaring dark gods."*

"Wow. Um. I'm sorry?"

He waves her away. "It is alright. I'm… reasonably certain your logic patch couldn't have actually hurt her. If only because of the suit's built-in safeties, which *someone* thoughtfully adjusted for baseline strength and durability beforehand. But next time, *ask a professional first.*"

"Yessir. I will do that." Soshten looks deflated. I pat her on the shoulder.

"I thought it worked great," I tell her. She gives me a rueful smile.

"Up until the point you tried to dance, swim, practice Kapa flex-meditation, or train in *sovran,*" mutters the medic, wiping several large logic trees with a few savage flicks of his wrist. He spends a few moments doing incomprehensible things to the computer screen, and then turns to me. "I've replaced the patch, Kestrel-ambassador. Your movements should hopefully feel more natural now?"

I hesitantly bend my waist this way and that. "I think so, yeah," I murmur.

"You will be pleased to know that when your suit is adjusted for gravitomimesis, it will *not* cause horrible and potentially painful glitches in the new code."

"That… is good to hear, thank you."


"He was an ass," I say as the door closes behind us. Soshten shakes her head.

"He was absolutely right to dress me down. I overstepped my bounds."

"Maybe, but he didn't have to be so hurtful about it. You were just trying to help."

"He was actually very forgiving and lenient with me. In his position I would have been a lot harsher."

"What!?"

"Sharp words leave lasting wounds. I will hopefully not be able to make such a mistake again without remembering how small and stupid I felt in there just now."

"That's… cold."

"The universe is a cold place, Kess. If we are to fill it with warmth, we must never mistake the source of that warmth for anything but our own hearts. Nature won't play by our rules no matter how proud we grow."

"Dammit, Soshi, I'm trying to comfort you here."

"You should not. I got what I deserved. You are very kind and thoughtful, but I am alright, Kess. You don't need to worry."

"If… if you say so," I murmur, taking her hand and squeezing.


"Hmm, I should get you a blindfold"


"Oh, and Kess?"

"Yeah?"

"If you were serious about submitting to military discipline, you should *really* put your voidskin back on. Nalshan isn't going to go easy on you just because you're a foreigner."

"How will he even know--"

"Because the suits record vitals and he will definitely notice the suspicious lack of a heartbeat for eight hours."

"I seriously have to sleep in this thing?"

"You're going to have to anyway shipboard, that's like half the reason these things exist. You'll be risking cancer or suffocation otherwise. Might as well get used to it now." The playful edge to her voice is gone; she sounds deadly serious now, almost worried. "Besides, those vital recordings are actually really important, especially since you're *uasdani* and we can't really make presumptions about your physiology. Once the suit has a profile for you, it can send automatic alarms if, you know, your blood pressure spikes, your heart rate gets too high, you have a panic attack, anything like that. That's important data for our medics to have if you get sick on Tel Casran some day, and it's *really* important your first tour on a spacecraft. You're going into an environment you've never been in before and if you have some kind of reaction -- Kess, I just want you to be safe."

I purse my lips. "Can it… if I'm having another "

"…promise me you'll stop fucking around with the programming?"

"Absolutely not," she replies smugly, taking my chin in her hands. Her emerald eyes almost seem luminous in the darkness. "I'm going to take advantage of you every chance I get," she whispers, her lips almost touching mine, "and when I'm through with you? You're gonna *beg* me for more."


"I had a thought last night." She keeps tapping away on the keyboard. "Your voidskin should be able to detect if you have another *shanvol* attack, right? Obviously the first thing to do is summon help, but I think also…" She narrows her eyes, taps a key a few times. "Ah, here it is. So, I can set it up so the suit effectors react on their own. Do you think that would help you cool down, or maybe keep you lucid long enough to dose yourself? Like, if an automatic massage protocol kicked in -- I could key the specifics, like if there's a particular way you like being touched that might help bring you back --"

"If you do that I'm just going to start associating that kind of touch with my attacks."

"Right. Yeah, sorry, you're right, that was stupid of me." She rubs her forehead distractedly. "So, randomize it, then." She punches a key and part of the complicated flow chart on her screen folds up and vanishes. "Do you think it would help, though? We can "

"Can you make it automatically give me a dose of that… that fentadone stuff?"

She winces. "Not without a medic's help, and believe you me it would hurt. When I… when my ship was attacked, my suit scrubbers were the only thing that kept me alive long enough for my CO to get me into my armor. So I know what it feels like when the venous feeds deploy and while I'm *very glad they did* I hope never to experience that particular sensation again."

I shrug. "How could that be worse than a… a *shanvol* episode?"

"It's not worse on its own, but it'll make you freak out even worse. The drug doesn't take effect instantly."

I think for a moment. "Nalshan said the suit has… resistors, to simulate gravity? For our muscles?"

"Yup."

"How strong can those get?"

"Pretty strong, they're designed for *randani*muscles  after all."

I'm quiet for a moment. I really don't want to give the devious little sadist ideas, but... "Could they work as a restraint? Just, resist all movement completely?"

"Yes they could, and we actually use that feature a lot. Helps with transporting patients, keeping muscle spasms under control, disciplining naughty cadets..."

Of course she had to go there. I roll my eyes. "Could you make it so if it detects… like if I'm panicking again, could you make the suit restrain me? So I don't, y'know. Hurt anyone."

She stops typing and turns to face me, pushing the laptop away. "I'm not gonna do that, Kess," she says somberly.

"What!?" I blurt. "If you can, then why not? That way--"

"Kess." She reaches out and takes my hand. "There's a million reasons that's a terrible idea -- first off being you wouldn't even be able to dose yourself -- and you don't even have a good reason to want me to do this."

"Not wanting to hurt people is a bad idea?"

"You cannot possibly hurt me or anyone else in this embassy. Even if you pulled a *gun* on me point *blank* I could easily dodge long before you pulled the trigger, and you don't *have* a gun."

"What if I panicked again and grabbed yours--"

She laughs aloud, pulls her pistol out of her holster, and tosses it to me; I catch it reflexively, my eyes widening at the number of safety regs she must have casually broken just now. "Go ahead. Try and shoot me." She spreads her arms wide. "I won't even dodge."

"What!?" I stare at her in shock. Gingerly I put the gun down on the table, pushing it away from me. "I will *not,* why would you--"

"Then point it at the window or something." She pushes the gun back into my hands, makes me close my fist around it. "Seriously, pull the trigger. I want to show you you have nothing to worry about."

"Is this some kind of fucked-up test--"

She sighs, and forces my finger down onto the trigger. The gun lets out a reproachful chirp, but nothing else happens.

"Only we can use our weapons. If you're not cleared, they won't fire, end of story." Gently she pries the gun from my frozen hands, and slots it back into her holster. "You have nothing to worry about. Look, Kess, I spent years in therapy, I know perfectly well what's going on here. This isn't about protecting anyone, you just still feel guilty because you tried to hit me the other morning."

"I tried to *kill* you!"

"That's adorable. Look, I've said it again and again -- you have your instincts for a reason. You probably wouldn't have survived without them and I am very glad you survived. You weren't in control that morning, you didn't do any damage, and you physically could not have done. You're trying to punish yourself over irrational guilt. Just let it go."

"I don't want to be a threat!"

"You're not. Kess, you are not a threat to me or any of the People. An untrained teenage girl could restrain you without breaking a sweat, and *everyone* that age has some level of UC training. I know you could hurt your own kind, but you're going to be in a place where we can intervene for four years at least. That's four years to sort yourself out. Unless you start sleeping with your own staff you have nothing to be afraid of. Or the other diplomats, I guess."

"I think that would be a national security nightmare."

"Hey, I don't judge." She slaps me on the rear. "Listen. I'm shit at this. Talk to Shalvan. "


"Mm." Shalvan nods slowly. "I agree with Comrade Soshten. "


"Regarding Comrade Soshten -- have you begun an intimate relationship with her?"

My cheeks immediately start burning. "What," I babble. "Y-wh-- you-- that is *none of your business--*"

Shalvan looks mortified, and claps a hand to his chest. "Forgive me! I did not realize this was a taboo topic."

"It's a *really fucking personal topic* is what it is," I blurt. "You can't possibly tell me that's a normal thing for you to discuss with your clients!"

"With my *patients,*" Shalvan softly corrects me. "And it is a perfectly normal topic to discuss. Among the People, that is. Such relationships are complex, and helping our citizens navigate intimacy with one another is one of the most important functions of a *virtash.*"

"Help navigate--? Do you think I need *help* finding her clitoris or something?"

"I mean *socially*, comrade." Shalvan holds up his hands. "Please, peace. I meant no offense, and from the bottom of my heart I apologize for so grievously offending you. I will not broach the topic again."

I breathe deeply for a moment. "You said… you work with the other Greens here."

"I do, yes."

"Does Soshten see you too?"

"She does."

"So are you telling me she's going to… to tell you all about--"

"If there are matters you do not wish her disclose to me in her counseling sessions -- or to anyone -- you may wish to advise her of this. Soshten is a kind and truly honorable woman, but she is only somewhat more familiar with your culture than I am. Clear, effective, and respectful communication is the keystone of all relationships; to such dramatically cross-cultural ones, trebly so."

I gaze at him. "You're really… okay with the fact that I'm sleeping with one of your security personnel? I thought… I thought this would be a huge deal."

He blinks. "Why?"

"Why!? Well, I-- she-- I mean, I'm an ambassador to a foreign power-- you guys take security *really seriously*--"

"Soshten is a mature woman who has a deep love for her comrades and her nation. There is no need to infantilize her. You can trust her not to use her position to exploit you for political leverage over your nation, and we can trust her not to let *you* use her in turn."

"I would *never*--"

"Nor would she. Beyond that, why should there be any reason for her superiors to interfere with your dalliance?"

I gaze at him quietly for a moment. "You people are… really accepting," I say slowly. He laughs heartily; it's an infectious laugh, one that sets me somewhat more at ease, and I can't help but smile weakly even though I don't know what the joke is.

"Accepting! No, no, not in the slightest, no. Of the galactic civilizations, we are *undoubtedly* the strictest, and we require absolute self-discipline, obedience, and loyalty from our comrades. We have no margin of tolerance whatsoever for antisocial or degenerate conduct, and exact severe punishments for a wide range of behaviors your Republic and the Empire alike would pay no heed to. What you perceive is not *acceptance*, Comrade Ambassador, but compatibility. Or did you think emotional intimacy between *uastashar* and the People was a commonplace occurrence?"

"I… didn't realize it was that special, no."

"It is. Virtually all of us expect a form and depth of connection that is rarely found outside homespace. For Comrade Soshten to take you for her own suggests she sees in you a kindred spirit. She is of a race cut off from your own and sculpted over a thousand years towards a harshly defined ideal of human perfection; she is a woman who has her entire life been relentlessly shaped into a loving comrade, a powerful warrior, and a thoughtful, responsible citizen. Between what she is -- what we all are -- and what the Zyahua, the Khmai, even the Kaparttu are, there lies a gulf so vast it is bridged only with great difficulty. Even the people of the League, for the most part, are but a single step closer to our nature than the people of the Empire or the Union."

"For the most part?" I tilt my head slightly, realizing moments later that I'm already imitating their facial mannerisms.

"Well, we have a pet name for the UA Diamond -- the _Ranuen_, the 'little Society,' you might very roughly translate it. Its people are most unusual, perhaps unique; there exists a degree of mutual admiration between our cultures, and theirs, though quite distinct, was modeled directly after our own. All the same, my point stands -- you are no Diamondite; indeed, from what you have told me I suspect their way of life would be intolerable to you. By bonding with one of the People, you have achieved something remarkable. Whether by accident, will, or the design of fate you have accomplished a closeness of soul to our own without any of the advantages we had in doing so. Yours is a baseline psyche, with your native sociopathic and self-serving traits fully intact, and without any of the early childhood training normally necessary to self-moderate. And yet you do so. To us, this is far more impressive than simply growing into a good citizen and comrade from within our system."

"That's the first time anyone's tried to *compliment* me by calling me a *sociopath*," I say slowly, unsure of how to react.

"No, no, please, you misunderstand -- oh, comrade, I do *so* apologize, again I offend in my ignorance --" he sounds genuinely anguished "-- I did not mean to suggest that you were an exemplar of those unsavory traits, merely that they exist untempered within your race."

I stare at him, my expresion held carefully neutral. "As... opposed to?"

"Our bodies are not the only thing we elected to modify in the execution of our eugenic program. Our spectrum of neurological expression has been slightly but substantively pruned, you might say, in order to depress or eliminate altogether certain traits deemed inimical either to individuals or to the Society at large."

"You… you *rewrote your own souls!?*" I take a deep breath. *You're a damn diplomat. Be diplomatic. Don't be an asshole no matter how much he sounds like Silverdawn right now.* "I… I'm sorry, this is a-a-a--a lot to process." My voice sounds slightly manic, even to me.

He tilts his head. "In what ways? Can I be of assistance?"

"Well… one, um, be *very very* careful who you tell this to? Obviously the Old Faith isn't entirely *popular* around here anymore, but there's still parts of it-- like, most of us still believe in God and Her Plan and we still believe that our souls are sparks of Her divinity. What you just *casually told me* is the *worst imaginable* kind of blasphemy. From the point of view of the faith, I mean. It throws the whole Plan into question."

"But we did not change our *souls.* That is likely beyond any power north of the Counterspin; perhaps beyond even the Echoes. Only our genetics, our physical brains--"

"You changed your personalities."

"We changed the way personalities develop within our race, yes."

"To any Zyahua that means you did *something* to your souls. We have enough reason to be afraid of you and how *alien* you are without being told that you *defiled shards of God* and maybe *ruined* the *entire purpose of Creation.*"

"…e-even though it has produced generations of increasingly compassionate and empathetic citizens? The societal benefits--"

"It doesn't *matter.* You're completely missing the point."

"Please forgive my ignorance! I have no background in comparative theology whatsoever."

I laugh weakly. "Well, me neither. I just know how I was brought up. And I know most of us would think that tampering with divinity is a whole higher order of wrong, sin on a cosmic scale. A lot of Zyahua would see you as abominations if they knew. I don't know about the other races, but I do know you'd be feeding a powerful gift into the mouths of Imperial propagandists."

Shalvan looks down, clasping his hands. "I… I see," he murmurs, sounding actually a little *upset.* "Well, I... appreciate the forewarning, Ambassador. I will caution my superiors to restrict this information -- if I have your permission to do so?"

"Yes, of course. There a form I need to sign?"

"When we've finished for the day, yes." Shalvan sets aside his slate. "Ambassador, I would like to ask -- you have been speaking in terms of the reactions of others, but your own discomfort is evident. How do *you* feel about what I have just revealed? Do *you* see us as abominations?"

"Wh-what? No!" I blurt, raising my hands. "Not at all, I -- I *like* you." My cheeks are suddenly hot, and I can't help but look away. "I don't know, it's been… difficult but… being here has been rewarding. It really has. Even just a couple days of getting to know some Greens. This place… I don't know *what* exactly it makes me feel because I've never felt it before but… it's not a bad thing." I lower my voice again. "Not at all."

"It is gratifying to hear that you think well of the People." Shalvan smiles, a note of relief in his voice. "What about your own faith? Can you reconcile it with this?"

I let out another fragile bark of laughter, massaging my forehead. "Oh, God. I haven't thought about questions like that in… in a really long time. I guess when you've seen what I've seen you stop thinking about the universe as if there's some sort of grand plan for all of Heaven. Priestesses just start to sound so hollow after a while, like some idiot civvie spilling platitudes after your best friend's just been blown to bits right in front of you. I don't really see any meaning out there, anymore. Just the meaning we make for it all ourselves."

He gives me a mischievous smile. "I believe I understand. Our own spiritual teachings are not entirely dissimilar."


Shalvan's eyes widen, and in a soft, low voice he asks gently, "Kestrel, are you saying -- in addition to everything else you've told me about -- you were *raped in the line of duty* as well?"

I shrug. "You don't got to be so dramatic about it. I… I don't even know what to call it. Like I guess it was rape more or less but… Shalvan, I've *seen* what came of girls we took back from the Guard. Civvies we rescued from bandits and other _dua yau wè_ lumpenprole opportunists. When I say that word 'rape' about what happened to me I feel like I'm making light of it all."

"Why so? Do you feel like your suffering was less real in some way, less genuine? --And please, you may call me Shal."

"I don't really think 'suffering' is even the right word, I just." I shrug again. "Shal-- we were at *war*. We were spending day after day bleeding and making other people bleed and watching enemies and friends and total innocents alike die in ways some of them so terrible I can't even think about it without-- without--"

He takes my hand, squeezes gently. "Shh. Stop. It's alright. I understand. You're safe. Nobody can hurt you here, and you can't hurt anyone either."

I inhale slowly. "Thank you. Look, my point is-- yeah, so the guys had their fun sometimes. So what. It's hard for me to begrudge them, knowing firsthand what they always got up and did next. For me, for their comrades, for us all."

"Are you telling me *they weren't even punished?*" Shalvan looks horrified. "They were left in the same unit to continue traumatizing their victims?"

I sigh. "We were still enforcing a lot of the customary law back then. If I had reported them they would have been burned alive. Shal, they didn't deserve that. Those boys-- they were my comrades in arms. They were part of my unit. I don't know if you understand this but that's something more than friends. I didn't let the *den tsuang* gun them down on the battlefield and I sure as *ash* wasn't gonna throw them to the flames myself neither. I'm still clinging to those last shreds of my honor."

"So you're saying, your rapist-- rapists? There were more than one?"

"There were a couple."

"Kestrel, *how many times did this happen to you?"*

"A lot, in the early days. Before I was a CO myself. After that-- well, you don't break ranks like that. Not unless she asks for it."

Shalvan squeezes the bridge of his nose distractedly. "So you were raped repeatedly by several different men over the course of your military career, you never reported it-- have you told anyone besides me? Did none of your own comrades even defend you?"

I sigh. "I... I'm not sure you get it, Shal."

"Help me 'get it', then."

"This wasn't some big secret and they weren't bad men. Not really. We all liked each other, we all looked out for each other. Some of them were honest-to-God heroes. One or two are big names today and they *earned* their fame, doing good work they ain't never could have done if I'd thrown them to the pyre out of some kind of… adolescent spite. Some of them saved my ass, my friends' asses, more than once even, and I'm always gonna be grateful for that. I don't resent 'em for doing what they had to do to me stay sane -- I didn't then neither and I sure don't now as all that pain and horror is long behind us. It's something we tell horrible jokes about at parties when old crews get back together, not some dark and hidden shame."

"Saving your life does not entitle a man to your body."

"Doesn't it? I don't know. What I do know is I felt awful ungrateful trying to fight back. They do you a solid, it's only right to give 'em one in turn. And Shal, those early days--" I shudder, groping for the dispenser on my desk just in case. "I saw some real rough and heavy shit towards the end, but that first year or two… maybe it wasn't so qualitatively ugly but there was just so much *more* of that ugly than later on. In the first years we didn't have stable territory. We didn't have a government. We barely had communications and we sure as shit hardly had anything close to military protocol. We were fighting just to survive at that point and the only reason we did was because the Blood hadn't called down the *d--* the Imperial Guard yet."

"So you're saying the early fighting was easier but more… chaotic and intense?"

"We hardly got any rest. In a normal war it's maybe 30% fighting, 70% sitting on your ass waiting for the bullets to start flying. The first two years was maybe 95/5 the other way around. I mean I'm exaggerating but you get my point. Some days you'd stumble to your cot too exhausted to dress down, flop down with your rifle still clenched in your arms, wake up three hours later to your bunkmate shaking you and explosions rattling the windows, and you'd go out and start shooting again before you'd had so much as a cup of _gue lang_ to steady your aim. Common courtesy was you'd make the rounds, make sure all your buddies remembered to eject their clips and clear their barrels before they passed out. If you had enough left in you to stand for that long. Did I mention we sometimes went days without eating?"

Shalvan is staring at me. "Merciful skies," he murmurs.

"When every day is like that -- you wake up to find your bunkmate on top of you and it is sometimes just hard to care. So you don't scream for help, you just lie there and take it, you don't waste your energy on fighting your own squaddies when the enemy's still out there, and then he helps you up and dresses you and you go out and climb into your rickety old excuse for a battle taxi and off you go to perforate some more skulls together. You talk like I should be all upset about it… Shal, I barely even *thought* about it most of the time. I spent so many of those days on full auto. Go here, go there, pull the trigger, return to base, bunk down for as long as God allows, rinse and repeat. Except it was a good day if we had enough time and water for the 'rinse' part." The dispenser chirps and I set it aside again with an unsteady hand, closing my eyes and silently begging the drug to kick in already. "The sex was part of the blur just like everything else. If anything, a warmer part. Human connection becomes so important in situations like that, big abstracts like 'consent' just stop entering into your head. The way the guys talked about it later on down the road -- you see a girl alone, exhausted, cut up and bruised, the *least* you're gonna do is go over and hug her and hold her while she cries on your shoulder. It would cruel not to, especially when the other men barely have the energy left to *breathe.* Sometimes sex was all I had to offer in return. Fuck, sometimes you just start taking each others' clothes off without either of you really starting it, and you don't even know each others' names, and you go off again without having exchanged a word because in situations like that, talking and thinking turn into priceless materiel you can't waste without a *life-or-death* good reason -- bullets at least get resupplied."

"You make it sound like being taken advantage of was just… routine." Shalvan's voice is a bit weak now. Well, he is a glorified civilian more or less. Come to think of it, how many Greens really could empathize with this? Even Soshten -- even her life-changing trauma was just one little incident with pirates.

"I was a woman in an army that didn't have so many at the time. You gotta understand, socialism wasn't really a big thing when we started out. Cormorant had her ideas and she had her lieutenants -- folks like me and Silverdawn -- but the actual *people* who signed on, most of the rank and file did it because they had their own grievances with the Blood. Some were proles tired of being worked to death all their lives for shit wages, some were peasants tired of being gouged by raiders and taxwomen. A lot were masculists of one breed or another. We pilfered some of their groups straight up, but there's a lot more men with masculist sympathies who don't actually run off into the wilds to join a band, maybe because raping and smoking themselves silly ain't their idea of a good time, maybe because they just didn't hate women hard enough to go full Patriarch. A lot of *them* saw our banner and rallied behind it, because one of the things Cormorant promised was we'd end the suppression of the stronger sex; they only picked up the rest of the ideology in bits and pieces. So this was an army full of bitter men kept down by my sex all their lives going through unspeakably awful things and keeping up the fight anyway, without hardly any comfort or peace or anything else but their hard-earned convictions to keep 'em going. And I mean, it wasn't like I was some… blushing maid halfway through puberty. Our men had their needs; I had mine too. I guess it was just… sort of an unspoken agreement. If you're lucky enough to get paired up with a girl *and* have some downtime, she's yours to do what you want with so long as she's still fit to fight by the time you're through with her and you keep her safe in the field."

"That… wasn't an *official* policy, was it?"

"No, not really. If anyone had actually objected mil-pol would have come down harder than a sack of bricks, I don't doubt. *They* were Cormorant's through and through, and most of 'em ladyfolk to boot. Far as I know, nobody ever did complain. I guess we all just felt like it was a necessity of war like any other, to keep morale -- theirs *and* ours, mind -- from collapsing completely. And the higher-ups knew this way the boys wouldn't end up making use of civvie women, so they tolerated it as long as we did. They'd kind of unofficially pass us around, make sure none of the boys were left out. But they never gave us orders to or anything. It was all basically under the table."

"Were *all* your male soldiers rapists?"

I sigh. "Shal, it's… it's complicated. It's complicated because it wasn't always like that. It wasn't always the man who'd start things, it wasn't always -- or even very often -- by force, even then it was almost never really, I don't know, hostile. Some of the boys, they'd always ask first and they'd take 'please, no, I'm too tired right now' like perfect gentlemen. Some would just shove you up against a wall first chance they got and slap you around if you whined about it, but they'd sit and clean your gun and trade morbid jokes with you while you pulled yourself back together, and you'd know plain from then on they wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for you. And some were just so good at teasing and winding you up that it felt kind of exciting when they finally pulled up your uniform.

"Sometimes it hurt and I'd just cry and cry but the boy would lay there with me and hold me close 'til I felt better, and I'd just cling to him for the rest of the day if I could. Sometimes I just felt nothing at all and the whole thing barely registered in my head. Sometimes it was just another chore to get over with before shipping out. Sometimes I-- well, it wasn't like they were an unattractive lot, or… unskilled. If you're going to spend your day up to your ankles in corpses, you might as well start it off with a climax or two. Sometimes that was the nicest part of my day, something to look forward to because I knew it'd start to feel good before he was through with me.

"And sometimes… I mean, shit, taking a cock feels a lot better than taking a bullet no matter the context. The sex just felt so trivial compared to what we were going out in every day that I didn't think much about it. Like bruising an elbow when you're being hauled off on a stretcher with a broken rib. Ash, sometimes I'd *tell* the boys outright to make it hurt so's it'd take my mind off my wounds. All in all, as long as we kept enough whorelily in supply for everyone, me and a lot of the other women, well -- we all kind of agreed more or less, it just felt like doing our duty for our comrades. We cared about them and they cared about us, a lot, and anyway it was hardly the worst part of the day even if we didn't enjoy ourselves. And sometimes it *was* fun. Do you… do you get, maybe, why this just isn't a big deal to me?"

Shalvan slowly nods. "I… yes. I think I was thrown off by the word *rape;* I understand why you did not wish to describe your… experiences that way. Ranuir has a more… nuanced vocabulary, and 'rape' translates in our dictionary of Zia Ţai as the most extreme end of that continuum."

I sit back. The drugs are kicking in now; a soft glow of pleasure is washing over my brain and out through my limbs. The panic is receding. I feel grounded, safe in reality. "I like learning your words," I murmur. "It helps me get my head around things."

He smiles. "I suppose sharing a few more of them can't hurt. Do you know *latias?*"

I shake my head.

"*Lat* is simply the body, your physical substrate as an incarnate soul. *Ias* is somewhat more difficult to translate. Literally it is 'violation' but I believe the Zia Ţai word carries emotional baggage *ias* does not. 'Intrusion' perhaps is a better fit. We use the term *latias* to describe crossing the bodily boundaries of another. It is a broad term. It can describe many kinds of assault and cruelty, including rape, however--" he touches me on the arm "--this is also *latias*. Our way of greeting one another begins always with an act of *latias,* an uninvited touch by the, er, _varin_ to the _selin_ that invites a similar touch in return. Hm, I'm not sure how--"

I hold up a hand. "It's okay. Soshten explained those words to me. They are really impossible to translate."

"Ah! Excellent, then." He smiles, relieved. "That makes this considerably easier. Well, *latias* is ultimately a way of putting another in their place. _Val varinte, ash selinte,_ it says -- 'I am _varin,_ you are _selin._' That is not always a bad thing, and it is not always a good thing.

"What you… experienced with your… male comrades was certainly *latias,* when you did not invite their intrusion through words or body language. Now there is another term, *iastesh*, which we use to describe various… sexual impositions. But *iastesh* does not mean 'rape'. Perhaps this is a cultural distinction -- among the People, it is understood that we do not always know what is best for ourselves. Sometimes our friends, our partners, our comrades in arms know us well enough to know better. For *ias* to be punishable, it is not enough to show simply that a violation took place; you must also show that it harmed you in some manner."

"That is… very different, yes." I purse my lips. "Our laws place a great deal of importance on *strict* bodily autonomy. If we were on Republic soil, a lot of your coworkers would have already been arrested for how they treated us."

"I see. Your law makes the body sacrosanct then?"

"I mean, up to a certain point. Obviously if you're doing a crime the militia can cuff you and drag you off without doing anything illegal."

"Ah, I see. In the Society, 'bodily autonomy' is not a term in the, hm, moral equation, you might say. It is simply not a consideration. What is considered is hurt and harm. This means you can be punished for causing someone distress by touching them, but also that you can be punished for *not* touching someone if you knew that would prevent distress -- restraining an unwell woman intent upon harming herself, for instance."

I shift in my seat. "That… explains some things."

"Our system recognizes that individuals are different, and that context determines what is and is not permissible. There is not a simple listing of objective 'laws' that our citizens can memorize and execute like a computer program; we hold ourselves to higher standards, so that the concern is not 'what is legal' but rather 'what is right.' Which, to a *civilized* person, is usually the easier question. For instance, you concluded it was not right to send men you cared for to a horrible death in retaliation for how they violated you; given the context, our system would agree."

"Really? You sounded really shocked--"

"Only because I misunderstood what exactly they did to you. When you said 'rape' I heard this as _teshruh,_ a betrayal of your bonds of camaraderie and common purpose, a selfish, spiteful act of sexual cruelty and exploitation that traumatized and damaged you without concern for your wellbeing. Instead it sounds like what you're describing is what we would call _gattesh_; 'forced sex,' you might say."

"There's a difference?"

"To us, forced sex is not inherently an act of betrayal, nor is it even inherently cruel. Human sexuality is not simply a matter of... negotiating the experience of physical pleasure between two partners. *That* is prostitution, a crude profanement by commodification of something exalted. In real sex there is flirtation, seduction, deception -- sexuality is something of a game we play, which arouses the soul as well as the body. The same physical act can be vastly more enjoyable depending on what precedes it. You yourself described this, when you mentioned that some of your male comrades could even make you look forward to being… perhaps 'ravished' is an appropriate word?… by toying with your desires and anticipation."

"Okay, yeah, that makes sense so far. Where are you going with this?"

"What I'm getting at is sometimes forced sex can actually be *more* pleasurable for women, create a stronger bond than ordinary consensual sex, especially in the beginning stages of a relationship. Context is everything, of course, and _gattesh_ is more easily done wrong than right. But establishing a relationship is a matter of breaking down boundaries, creating a shared ground of intimacy between two souls, and this can be legitimately done by force. The way this usually plays out is there is a man and a woman, or more rarely two women, who share unresolved sexual tension; by flirting and various teasing forms of *latias,* the man can establish an emotional charge and a sense of anticipation in the woman, to the point where she experiences intrusive thoughts about him. Instead of allowing the relationship to form gradually, he takes bodily control of her while she is still trying to resist those intrusive thoughts instead of accepting the attraction, and forcing physical pleasure upon her until she stops resisting and starts enjoying herself. Once he releases her, the relationship essentially becomes a 'done deal'; she has been directly confronted with her attraction, she now associates him with strength, confidence, and physical pleasure, and on top of all this he has taken advantage of her neurological hardwiring. It is a dangerous way to try to establish a relationship but when it works it creates extremely strong bonds of affection and obedience, and tight emotional bonds are very highly prized among the People.

"Now, I use this as an extreme example. Obviously this doesn't describe your interactions with…" He stops, apparently noticing my burning cheeks and averted gaze. "Ambassador?"

"I… it m-might describe… *some* of those, um. Interactions." I squeeze my thighs together awkwardly. "Um. What do you mean, taking advantage of 'neural hardwiring?'"

"Ah, I apologize; I am being unnecessarily cryptic. I simply mean the innate reaction of the female psyche to sexual intercourse, forced or otherwise."

"Innate… reaction? Sorry, I'm missing something here."

Shalvan gives me that goddamn look again. "Do you… forgive me, there must be some confusion, surely you know about--"

"Explain it as though I don't."

"Very well. Stop me when you recognize what I'm talking about. Obviously there are profound and innate differences between the male and female psyche, somewhat more so among _uasdannar_ than _randannar_ as a result of our efforts to… ameliorate certain masculine excesses and feminine pathologies. One of these differences is that, for women, the sexual act physiologically triggers a response in the brain -- a release of oxytocin, among  other things -- that changes your disposition towards your partner. In effect, when you have sex with someone that results in climax, particularly penetrative sex with a man, you will start to like him more and feel more and more attraction to him. What's important to understand is that this response is entirely involuntary. It doesn't matter who the man is, it doesn't matter how you feel about him beforehand, it doesn't matter if the intercourse is forcible or mutual." He tilts his head. "Does this sound familiar yet?"

I stare at him. "What in all ash makes you *think* that?"

"Ah -- well, virtually every known galactic culture has treated this as 'common sense' knowledge, and it has been backed up by a great deal of research and experimentation. We understand the exact physiological mechanism and neurological pathways involved and we've identified some of the genes responsible." He blinks several times. "Truly, you weren't aware--"

"Nobody ever told me that!" I burst out. "Nobody ever in all my life -- you're sure about this, that this isn't just a, a Green thing?"

"It is practically an axiom of modern psychology," Shalvan returns evenly. "One that is necessary to explain a wide variety of barbarian practices, such as bride raiding, and which we've found no exception to among any human race, no matter how far removed. The mechanism is very deeply embedded, clearly dating to our presentience."

I stare at my hands. "Why did no one tell me this," I mumble, my eyes unfocused. Shalvan touches my thigh softly.

"Perhaps this is simply not common knowledge in the Empire. A completely female-dominated culture would need some level of self-deception to remain that way in the long term; the position of the sexes under the Imperial system could easily give rise to a… distorted… narrative…" Shalvan trails off.

I'm hunched on the couch, my arms tight around my legs, shrinking back agains the seat. Even the warm, comforting haze of the not-opium can only do so much to blunt the sharp edges of the thoughts that are scraping across my soul. I don't look up when Shalvan perches on the couch next to me, takes my hand in his and squeezes softly. "Kestrel?" he says after a moment.

"Yeah?" I whisper, unable to meet his gaze.

"Talk to me, if you can."

"Nobody told me. Nobody-- I never knew--" I take deep breaths, try to stop myself from hyperventilating. "Shalvan, you're telling me any guy -- fuck, maybe even any old Guard bitch -- could have just taken me and kept me prisoner and raped me over and over and eventually *I would have started to like it.* Fuck, they *still could, fuck--*"

"Kestrel! Kestrel." He squeezes my hand tightly. "Nobody is going to hurt you. We will not let anybody hurt you; we will not let anyone take advantage of you. Your people are here. You have a bodyguard -- two bodyguards, to judge from the size of your chief of staff -- and you have us. Your safety is one of our highest priorities. There will always be someone who can come running to protect you and on Tel Casran no enemy will be able to reach you. No matter what else, right now *you are safe.*"

My jaw is trembling and I nearly bite my tongue as I try to speak. "All those years. All those years I didn't know. I was out in the open and anyone could have just-- God, my people-- *Sparrow--*"

"Shh. You saved Sparrow." Shalvan puts an arm around me and instinctively I crumple against him, shivering. "Nobody got to you."

"Shal I have been held down and fucked by men ten times stronger than me, I have been a prisoner of war, I've been strapped to a gurney so's a doc could cut into me and stitch up a torn vein, I have been in so many different fucked-up situations and I have never, never felt so fucking *helpless* as I do right now. Never."

"Why is that? What about this new information makes you feel helpless?"

"Because I was always *me.* I always had my mind, my soul, wasn't nobody could take that away from me. I knew what was right and what we were fighting for and there was no pain, no torture in the world could change me if I didn't let it. That's what I thought this whole time, that's what I clung to in my worst moments, and now you're telling me--" Now I *am* hyperventilating, I realize. I struggle for control, trying to slow my breathing before I pass out. "You're telling me that was all an illusion. You're telling me being a woman means I'm just-- I'm vulnerable and there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, God--"

"Shh, no. No, no, Kestrel; it's not that bad. Listen, listen." He squeezes my hand tightly, patting me on the shoulder. "Humans are an old species. Our brains, our mentalities have several different layers to them. At the core is the *uasmad,* the… the animal, the id, the beast, the atavistic core from which all our strongest passions and desires and worst instincts arise. Atop that is a superstrate of intellect that makes us creatures of reason, able to override our bestial impulses as no mere animal can. For some of us there is another layer, a lattice of strictures that is itself a product of that intellect, imposed through eugenics or genetic engineering. Then atop even that is one last layer of our sentience, a layer that changes and grows and becomes more complex for as long as we live. That is our identity, our personality.

"The part of a woman that makes her bond to a sexual captor is in that animalistic core. It's part of you the same way as a man's urge to murder another who has disparaged his honor. Or the urges we all share, to eat when we are hungry and drink when we are thirsty. These instincts are powerful of course, but they are still the basest part of us. That means they are subordinate to the higher layers. No matter how hungry you might be, you can always keep yourself from eating food you know is poisoned.


"We teach that our dark side is not a burden, but a gift. It is a source of tremendous passion, drive, ambition, and pleasure -- albeit one that must be managed responsibly, not allowed to overcome that part of the soul which walks in light. We teach our children from a very young age about their dark side, and we teach them how to control it, how to keep from being overwhelmed by black urges and intrusive thoughts. This requires lifelong vigilance, and discipline, and a careful understanding of the soul, but it can be done and our entire civilization is proof of this; we have all but eliminated the many great evils that spring from the darkness of the human soul and plague other civilizations to this day. Greed, egotism, arrogance, sociopathy -- all trouble us little, and we can turn our attention to higher things.

"I understand your fear, and I regret with all my heart that I spoke carelessly and frightened you so. But you are not so helpless as you think, nor so vulnerable. When our teenage girls go through puberty, we teach them carefully about their own bodies and psyches, and how they differ from their male comrades. We teach that sexual intimacy is something you must approach with more care and vigilance than must a man. We teach how your bonding instinct affects your emotions and might sway your reasoning in an unguarded moment, how to spot the signature traces of unreason it leaves upon your thoughts. We teach how to select partners carefully, how to spot the signs that someone is misusing your bonding instinct to control you against your best interest, and we encourage girls to experiment with one another before they take the plunge and embark on relationships with boys. None of this can neuter your bonding instinct and take away its power over you; that is part and parcel of your womanhood. But it can shift the balance of power away from your *uasmad,* your id, and towards your conscious, rational mind. And it can change your bonding instinct from a vulnerability you live in fear of, into a tool you can choose to employ for your own social and emotional betterment. If it would bring you comfort I can provide you this same training before you venture out again into the world."

"Yes. Please. If you think it will help me."

"I do. If nothing else it should certainly restore your confidence in your own judgment."

Slowly, I let my legs drop to the floor. I'm still resting against Shalvan's shoulder, and he passes me a handkerchief to wipe my runny nose. "What do you mean about making… making my bonding instinct into a 'tool?'"

"Well, one of the most common functions of sex in our culture is to improve social and military cohesion. For instance, an executive officer might submit sexually to her commanding officer to improve their working relationship and to create a deeper psychological pressure to obey his orders. Synchronizing military rank with social role orientation is quite helpful in the field, we've found; it reinforces discipline dramatically, especially in units with low morale or suffering exhaustion, since they can then actually *rely* on their base instincts instead of burning willpower trying to suppress them for the sake of the military hierarchy. This is actually one of the many reasons we default to male-female CO-XO pairs where possible."

I stare up at him. "You let… oh my God, I have *so* many questions."

He laughs. "Perhaps you can make a list, and Comrade Nishuin will be able to help you answer them. Ah, speaking of Nishuin: It does not escape my attention that I have now several times caused you emotional injury due to my extreme ignorance of your culture. This is completely unacceptable; it is the precise *opposite* of my purpose here, and so I would like to ask you if you would be comfortable with Comrade Nishuin attending some of these sessions. I would share my notes with her to some extent and use her feedback to better prepare a course of treatment. Obviously this is a very intimate thing to involve another person in, and I realize that intimacy poses certain challenges for you, so I wished to bring up the possibility and give you some time to consider it before you make a decision. But I would strongly encourage it, particularly as Nishuin is attached to your embassy, while I am of course bound to this base and will not be able to maintain continuity of care once you depart the planet."

"Uh… wow, okay. She's really okay with that idea?"

"I have not broached the subject out of respect for your confidentiality, but she will of course be willing to assist."

"H-how do you know that?"

"Culture Liaison is her role. It is what she is here for."

"She's Liaison to the *Embassy*. Not to… not for my personal life! That's--"

"Not a meaningful distinction to us. In any case, it is no secret she admires you greatly." He smiles. "I am certain she would leap at any chance to be of use to you."

"Okay, well. Um. I'll… I'll think about it. It… would be good to have someone here who… who understands these things about us, I just…"

"I understand. Please take all the time you need."


"Shalvan… explained to me what this… relationship really means. I…" I fiddle with my hair awkwardly. ""


"You can *rebuild* folks' *whole bodies*?" I sit bolt upright. "How-- how is that even-- how do you *do* that?"

She shrugs. "Kess, I'm not a surgeon. That's really advanced stuff, I barely know anything about it. The only medicine I know is basic field work."

"Soshi, we have so many people -- boys paralyzed by explosions, folks who jumped on grenades and lost their limbs. One of my friends, we had to mercy-kill him because he-he--" The tears are welling up already. "He couldn't see and he couldn't hear and he couldn't move; he was just trapped inside what little was left of his mangled body. And you're saying he didn't have to die, you could have saved him--"

"We have the tech for it, yeah. For our own people, anyway. I met a man once who lost most of his body fighting a fire and you'd never know anything bad had happened to him just to look."

"Why didn't-- you could have *given us this,* you could have told us how-- none of those people, those brave soldiers, those poor civvies in the wrong place at the wrong time-- all those arms torn off and eyes lost to shrapnel and field amputations--" I breathe deeply, fighting to keep myself under control, but the words are spilling out faster than I can even think them. "God, Soshi, you gotta help us, there's so many people--"

*"Kess."* Soshi grabs me by the shoulders. "Kess, stop. *Breathe.* Listen, okay? Listen to me. Please? Just let me talk for a minute."

My mouth moves silently for a moment, then I crumple back against the wall. "Okay," I whisper, my voice cracking.

"Look. This… please, I get it, I really think I do, I understand why you're so upset, so… this." She screws up her face in frustration, making a gesture I don't understand; I wonder distantly if she doesn't know the right words. "I get how important this must be to you. But this is… Kess, I'm *just a soldier.* I'm just an embassy guard. The things you're talking about? This is *really high-level stuff.* We have one clinic, *one*, in our entire volume that can do body reconstruction, on Tel Casran. They do, I don't know, maybe ten major procedures a year. This kind of stuff, we almost *never* need it. It's *rare* for us to get injured so badly. I know you want to help your people, this must feel so unfair, but we literally do not have the capacity. We can't medevac thousands of your soldiers to Tel Casran and treat them all. That would take… decades, maybe centuries depending on how many critically wounded you have. And it would take enough resources to bankrupt a planet. Space travel isn't easy and it's not very safe and these surgeries take a lot of manpower, energy, tech, resources, and we're not used to doing things *en masse* like this, we just don't have the procedures for it. And that's not even getting into the politics of letting so many *uassurinar* into our capital.

"As for sharing this tech with you, I'm not sure you realize what you're asking here. That's a huge, political question. It's way over my head. I'm just an embassy guard, I can't talk about this stuff, I can't *negotiate* with you." She squeezes my arm. "Talk to Nishuin, okay? This is her job. She can give you real answers and she can arrange a meeting with the actual Ambassador for you to negotiate with."

I close my eyes, breathing deeply for a while. As my adrenaline slowly recedes, I start feeling *really* stupid.

"I'm sorry, Soshi."

"Shh. It's okay."

"That was really… stupid and selfish and unfair of me. I wasn't thinking at all. I'm sorry for treating you like… like you *are* the Society. Just, the way you talk, the way you all know so much, you're all on the same page -- I'm really not used to that and it really messes with my thinking. I'm sorry."

*"It's okay.* I understand, Kess."

"Do you think…" I swallow hard. "Do you think we'll be able to figure something out? To help my people?"

She sighs. "We all *want* to help. Everyone from Nishuin to the Ambassador to the Big Three themselves. I'm sure if you ask, they'll try to find *some* way of helping your people within the rules. They wouldn't be in that position if they were so callous as to say, 'no, they're not special enough.'"

"But?"

"But it's complicated. We have to put our own safety, our own culture and supremacy first. What if the tech you want, what if it can do things besides heal people? What if it could be used as a weapon? Maybe even against us! There's a *reason* we don't just uplift all our allies to the same level we're on. It would mean catastrophe -- for us, for the cause, for the *Galaxy.* Some powers *have* to be reserved to us, because we're the only ones who *can* keep them safe, keep them aimed in the right direction.


"Tech transfer is…" Nishuin sucks air through her teeth, shaking her head. "It is *never* undertaken lightly, and requires approval at the highest levels. The only reason we can even *discuss* this is we *amended our constitution* shortly after the war. Before, tech transfer would have been categorically impossible. What if it turned out the tech we gave you could be used for creating bioweapons? Can we trust that you will never use that technology in a way that would harm our interests? Can we trust that your government would keep it from falling into the wrong hands? Can you?

"And, frankly, tech transfer is only part of the equation. We are a highly advanced nation, Comrade Ambassador; our infrastructure is entirely unlike anything to be found on your planet. Even if we *did* give you the technologies you want, there is no guarantee you would be able to use them without perhaps centuries of building out new infrastructure and training new personnel. Virtually all of our technology rests on miniaturized computers, which require microprocessor foundries, standardized operating systems, communication protocols, and so on. Simply transplanting technology from one culture to another, *even if* they are at the same general level of technical and infrastructural sophistication, is almost never possible unless the cultures have gone to the effort of maintaining both parity and *interoperability* between their systems of infrastructure. Consider crude oil -- while a plentiful, relatively compact source of dirty energy on 'old growth' greenhouse worlds, it has long been considered worthless on the general market, sometimes even for cross-region trade, due to differences in composition and quality between various sources and extraction processes. Whole systems of infrastructure must be tightly attuned to the composition of local sources to be able to produce tradeworthy plastics and fuels.

"Culture also cannot be overlooked. I have the utmost respect for your people, Comrade Ambassador, but the unfortunate fact remains that you are culturally yet primitive. A certain level of cultural and philosophical sophistication is required to be able to handle many technologies responsibly. Otherwise, the shock of their sudden introduction can spawn pathologies throughout the cultural environment, which can themselves impede or even fatally arrest the natural development of culture towards a point where it would become possible to wield the technology responsibly and effectively -- this in particular is why we have a standing moratorium on helping other cultures establish pervasive communication grids for civilian use. The ability to customize and endlessly rebuild one's body is *disruptive.* You have a population of several billion. Could you handle a sudden dramatic rise in lifespans? Could you handle the strain that the demand for reconstructive services would put on your economy and planetary ecosphere? Could you handle the social repercussions of triaging or otherwise rationing access to the technology? Rebellions have erupted over less.

"Consequently, I do not believe that tech transfer would be a productive topic to discuss with our Ambassador. *However,* let us not lose sight of the concrete problem you wish to address. There may be ways for you to get what you want for your people without confronting any of the risks or complexities inherent in tech transfer."

My heart has been sinking throughout her speech, but I feel a sudden manic flash of hope. "What would you suggest?"

"Offhand? While we undoubtedly have the most *sophisticated* bodily reconstruction technologies in the Socialist world, there are other polities in the Socialist League and without which have developed the same basic technique. For instance, the Unitary Authority of Diamond. They have a much larger population than we do, and while they do not have the scientific and intellectual resources of Topaz, their systems of government and organization are such that it is very easy for them to adopt and iterate on new technologies and ideas. One of these technologies is organ and body reconstruction, and unlike us they are equipped to use it on a much wider scale.

"My suggestion is therefore this: speak with the UA Diamond's ambassador when you arrive on Tel Casran. Diamond is a deeply militarized culture that values honor, chivalry, and martial prowess as cardinal virtues, whose population all serve time in the armed forces -- honorable service is in fact the only reliable route to high office." She smiles. "Given your background and sex, I can more or less *guarantee* that Diamond's ambassador will *jump* at the chance to meet you, and will be very receptive to any request you make of him for aid."

I sigh. "I don't like flaunting my womanhood at friendlies like that. Making innocent men feel threatened just to get what I want feels wrong to me. But I suppose if that's what it takes--"

"That is not what I mean at all! Perhaps you misunderstood -- Diamond has been a League world for centuries and no longer upholds traditional Zyahua gender norms. Men will not feel threatened by you; "

"I spent several months on Diamond during my training as a Liaison. I can assure you it is a civilized world and a lovely place to be a woman. I will say that Diamond men are very flirtatious, and the way they flirt is very physical and possessive; I can imagine that might perhaps cause a Zyahua woman to feel threatened or assaulted. Personally, however, I enjoyed my time among them. I should note also  that Diamond men are *very* protective of us, and would intervene immediately if they were to witness a woman -- especially one of their own, or a Society citizen -- being mistreated. They revile the Patriarchs no less than any other majority-Zyahua culture.


I'm swept away from the battlefield by a jarring tone, a noise that's coming from everywhere and nowhere, growing louder as the landscape of carnage and twisted metal dims and recedes into the fog. My lungs are gasping for air and I lunge forward, looking back and forth wildly, and I catch a glimpse of light.

I clutch my own body. The wounds and dirt are gone, my uniform gone. My skin is wrapped in a tight fabric, smoother than silk, covering most of my body except my head and hands. As I fumble in the blackness I feel someone beside me -- a woman, judging by the softness of her skin and the slimness of her arms. She's unmoving, breathing slowly. Reflexively I check her pulse. Irregular heartbeat. A casualty? Adrenaline surging once more I move to straddle her, only for my legs to get caught in the blankets—

Blankets.

I breathe deeply.

I was in bed. I just woke up.

How long was I out? I must have been medevac'd-- *hang on*.

How much of that was a dream?

The noise, an insistent chirping, is still there, but it's quiter now, relegated to the background, not consuming my universe. I rub enough sleep from my eyes to be able to focus in the dark.  I stare at the woman I'm straddling, looking for some kind of clue, and I find it in her face.

*Soshten.*

I collapse back into bed, breathing hard, clutching my face and nearly sobbing with relief as my brain puts the pieces back together, true memories forcing their way past false ones. The violence of my landing is enough that Soshten stirs, and she sits up, head cocked.

"Mmh. Kess. Door."

"Wha…?"

She spares me a glance, a low light rising in the little dormitory as her fingers find a bedside control. "…I'll get it," she murmurs.

I still feel slightly dizzy as I hear the door slide back. The hallway outside is dimly lit with silver light that makes me think of moonlight. I hear a woman's voice, and sit up.

"--deeply apologize fo--" A strangled halt. _"Soshten-surin?"_

_"Nishuin-surin."_ Soshten's leaning in the doorway, at ease in very little clothing. She slaps Nishuin on the shoulder. _"Sona valari til etgano val case."_

_"Lahi narai elena risesh, surin!"_ Nishuin bows deeply, returning the gesture and then clasping her hands together. _"Mol mase. Niltasha shirane."_

Soshten steps back, eyes widening. _"Shos."_ She glances at me. "Kess. Something's up."

I stare blearily at the two women. "Up? What…?"

Nishuin hesitates for a moment, then crosses the threshold. Soshten reacts violently, instantly grabbing Nishuin by the throat and shoving her against a wall with her free hand. _"Nishi!"_ she erupts, sounding genuinely *furious.* _"Hal shose!?"_

That's worth at least a cup or two of deep black tea. Before I know it I'm on my feet, momentarily disoriented as I try to compensate for a war wound my suit is already compensating for. I catch myself and close the distance to the two _rantashar._ "What the *fuck* has gotten into you, Soshi?" I demand. She spares me a dumbfounded glance. "I thought I was supposed to be the crazy one here--"

Nishuin has her hands up, as if in a gesture of surrender. "Peace, peace. Do not fault her, ambassador; she acted only to protect the sanctity of your ho-- your, eh, hm, r-residence? I acted in haste when I should have communicated. The blame is mine."

"Can you please let her go? It's okay." I touch Soshten by the arm. She gives me a dubious look.

"She has your permission to come in?"

"Yes! Yes, she has my permission." I rub my forehead as Soshten reluctantly lets go of Nishuin's throat. "Matikhe's swollen balls, is that was this is about? Some weird territorial--"

"If I may." Nishuin touches us both softly on the shoulder. "I wish to explain, but time is a factor. Would you walk with me?"

I glance at Soshten, whose expression makes me think of a kicked _pien şai_. "Yeah." I take her hand and squeeze it, and she brightens up a bit. "Can Soshi-- um, Comrade Soshten accompany us?"

"Please." Nishuin seems completely unruffled by the assault. We follow her out into the hallway. Wherever she's going, she's in a hurry; keeping up is even more difficult than last time.

"I'm… sorry about that," Soshten murmurs to us both. "It seems like I… I misunderstood something."

"Think nothing of it." Nishuin squeezes her arm gently. "Ambassador, you must understand: among our people, the… place in which a citizen customarily sleeps, I suppose, is inviolate. To cross the threshold without vocal acquiescence -- usually by a specific set phrase -- is not merely violation but assault, an act of violence against the person."

Soshten nods silently.

"I know this is not so in your culture. I interpreted your response as implicit permission for me to draw near. I… was not expecting you to be accompanied by another of the People, and I was not in the right mindframe for dealing with complex cross-culture interactions. A function of surprise and fatigue."

"So you do get tired, huh."

Nishuin smiles. "We have accomplished many things through the Ranshavlin, but I think sleep will be with us for a long time to come. For one, I do not mind."

"I meant you personally, Nishuin," I tell her. Soshten snickers.

*"Oh.* I see." A quiet, tittering laugh. "As I was saying -- I failed to factor in Soshten's presence and her lack of cultural instruction. Her anger and her forceful reaction were fully justified; indeed, she seems quite possessive of you, to jump so quickly to your defense." There's a note of amusement in her voice now. "You are a fortunate woman, comrade. This way."

I glance at Soshten. She looks away, flushing slightly. "Does the whole embassy know we're sleeping together?" I ask plaintively.

"No, no," Nishuin assures me. "It was simply obvious from context."

"You *said* there was a *situation, Nishuin,*" says Soshten loudly.

"Quite so. I do apologize for rousing you at an uncivilized hour, ambassador; I hope you will not take this as disrespect--"

I wave her away. "It's fine. Has something happened with my people?"

"Hm. Yes, in a way. Not your staff here in the embassy, but--" She stops, touching her fingers to a plate by a door. After a moment it lights up green around the edges and the door unlocks. She slides it back and beckons us to follow her inside.

This room is brighter than the hallway. It's a conference room, with gigantic display panels covering most of the curved walls, the rest being frosted-glass window. The panels are all lit, and while the script is alien and the icons largely unrecognizable, the visual and kinetic structure of some of the readouts is all too familiar. There are five people already here, two operating sleek terminals built into the conference table.

At the head of the table, the ambassador rises to great me.

"Kestrel-comrade. Thank you for coming. I apologize for disrupting your sleep." She touches me on the shoulder; I touch her shoulder in turn. Her voice is soft, but there is no trace of warmth in her eyes, and her expression is troubled.

"I hope I can be of service, Ambassador. What's the situation?"

She turns, gesturing to one of the wall panels. "Do you know what this is?"

"That looks like a radar disc." I purse my lips. "Sort of."

"Many scanning technologies are integrated here, but you will lose no critical insight if you think of it as radar." She indicates a pattern of dots on the screen. "Colors represent IFF signals for local powers. Our assets are coded green, Imperial assets are coded red, League assets -- your Republic included -- are coded blue."

There's something off about how she says "your Republic" that sets off all kinds of alarms in my head.

The ambassador taps the screen. "This thick line is the boundary between sovereign Society airspace and our aircraft identification zone. Per our agreements with your Republic, as a diplomatic courtesy, Destiny Garden is *supposed* to contact us in advance if your aircraft are to enter our ADID zone."

I gaze at the radar, at the blue dots swarming through the identification zone, a white glyph blinking urgently in their centers. "You weren't given notice."

"Friendly flyovers are rare. Your air force has little business here; it is an unpopulated area where we handle the routine patrols and share our onworld ISR assets, as part of the same courtesy."

"And those aren't recon flights. Way too many bogies, way too close together. Do you have eyes on them? Any idea what line--"

A smile flashes briefly across Lifuin's face. It's like part of her wants to drop the cold, professional facade and . Instead, she says, "Those are Shatterhawks, if the name means anything to you."

*Crap.*

The Shatterhawk. Local design, League engineering and tech. Vertical take-off and landing. Able to switch between hover and high-speed scramjet flight. They're gunships, meant to get from one place to another in the blink of an eye and then unload white hot death on the adversary while her ears are still ringing from the sonic boom.

There's over thirty blue dots on the screen, moving fast. I didn't realize we had that many in service already. Last I heard we were still in the prototype stage. I guess Silverdawn liked her new toys.

"I want to believe this is just a breach of diplomatic protocol. It's the most likely explanation." Lifuin indicates the lines stretching out behind the flock of Shatterhawks, tracing their paths. "None of their flight plans appear to intersect our airspace. If things continue as they are, the aircraft will pass out of our identification zone in around fifteen minutes."

"If." I turn my gaze back to her. She nods, still staring at the screen.

"In under three mintues, the airfleet will be in a position where they can adjust their trajectories such that they will *all* converge on the Embassy at the same time. From multiple angles, arriving nearly simultaneously. If they make that course-correction, we will have less than a minute of notice. *Ambassador, this does not sit well with me.*"

I feel a sinking feeling in my gut.

"Get Silverdawn on the line," I say quietly. "Now. Make whatever threats you need to to get her awake and talking. I will own the fallout."

Lifuin half-turns towards the conference table, snapping her fingers. Someone lifts a handset from its receiver and begins issuing commands.

"You see what I see," she says softly.

"The thing about battle that makes it so goddamn terrifying," I mutter, "is all the noise and flying dirt. The darkness and the muck. When shit goes down you have so much you have to figure out and you have a split *second* to do it in if you're lucky. Figure out where the shots are coming from. What cover is safe. Civvies freeze up in that kind of stress. And standing still on a battlefield is the fastest way in God's Creation for a man to die." I look at Lifuin, and this time she meets my eyes. "Tonight, our treaty is that fog of war. And someone's hoping you're that civvie who can't make hard calls fast enough."

"Kestrel," she says, her voice quiet, and this time it's Lifuin talking, not the Society of Worlds Ambassador to Sapphire. "Your honest opinion."

"Yes?"

"Would your government *do* this? Is your president… would she turn on us?"

I stare at the floor for a little bit too long. Lifuin's posture shifts. Alarm.

"You get why I need to talk to her," I say finally.

Lifuin nods.

"Ambassador."

"Yes?"

"Are those 'Hawks a serious threat to you?"

"That," Lifuin answers weakly, "depends entirely on how long we wait to start shooting."

"Do you have air raid shelters?"

"Yes." Aloud, she snaps an order in Ranuir. Then to me: "Everyone except defense personnel will be evacuated to the shelters. Your people included."

"Can you make an exception? For Jay and Bear?" I clasp my hands behind my back. "I think I might need them."

She nods, distant. She calls out another order. "They will be escorted to us."

"Thank you."

Her eyes fix on mine again. "Thank *you,* Kestrel," she replies. "I hope I am not asking you to face your fears for us."

I smile weakly. "If it's to be a fight, a fancy Green military base is an outright luxurious place to watch the fireworks from, by my standards."

She takes me by the shoulder, pulling me to one side. She lowers her voice. "Kestrel. Your strength of character is admirable, truly, but if at any point you require assistance or psychiatric attention, please notify myself or a member of my staff *immediately.* I would have you understand, you are of the most assistance to us lucid and well, and I would not see your compromise this for the sake of appearances. None here will think less of you if you need to step aside at any point. Are we understood?"

I think of Shalvan. My instinct is to argue, to push back and make light. Instead, I nod. "Yes, ma'am."


"You've confirmed those are Shatterhawks?" She nods. "And the IFF. How certain are you it's valid?"

"Fully. We have restricted but live access to your planetary defense grid, certain databases we share for the sake of mutual security. It's not just a matter of matching signatures -- the keypairs are listed active in the IFF issuance register and match the craft transmitting."

Right. *Diplomatic courtesy.*

_"Niltash._ Silverdawn _osro vade."_

The ambassador beckons. A technician approaches; I flinch as she touches the small of my back and she backs away, holding up her hands, a small, curved device clutched in one.

*"Tch* -- I forget myself. Forgive the intrusion, comrade Ambassador." Lifuin sounds *stressed.* Understandable, given the circumstances, but it's a little bit fucking *terrifying* seeing the unflappable People showing *weakness.* "It is a headset. You may speak to your president without our voices intruding. Touch the contact by the earpiece if you need to take the conversation private, by the mouthpiece if you need to put her on hold."

I stare at the map in trepidation as the technician attaches the headset to my left ear, and then steps quickly away, bowing. The voice is so clear I almost spin to the left as it comes through.

"Office of the President. To whom am I speaking?"

I exhale softly. It's her secretary, Hazel.

"Haze. It's me, Kestrel. I need to speak to Silverdawn *right* this fucking instant."


Hazel's too young to have ever been a soldier, but that aggravating *frivolity,* that*indecisiveness* that plagues civilians is totally absent from her. She's sweet and she's fun but she's *hardcore.* She'll laugh and dance and sing with the best of them, but she doesn't mess around -- if she were ever in a position where she had to kill, she wouldn't freeze up, she wouldn't panic, she wouldn't have a hysterical fit and get taken hostage. She'd *pull* that goddamn trigger and she'd save the sobbing breakdown for the nearest secure location.

I *like* Hazel. She's everything about civilians that I love, with none of the attendant frustrations.

Maybe she's the person I wish I'd had the chance to be.

"Understood," she answers briskly, and I can hear her flipping switches in the background. "Putting you through."

"Silverdawn. What the sublimated *fuck* are you doing?"

A yawn. "My *darling* General.* I am doing a great many things. *Sleeping*, foremost among them. It would *help* if you could make your wild accusations a touch more specific."

God *damn* it. I could fucking strangle her right now. This much on the line and she's *playing with me.* It's like a fucking compulsion with this woman.

"This is not the time for games." If I'd been holding a conventional phone, I'd be squeezing the cable in both hands like I wanted to do to her *neck.*

"And it's not the time for you to be *cryptic,* either!" She actually sounds as exasperated as I feel right now, which only makes me angrier. She's-- we're *both* probing, insisting on finding out just how much the other one knows, and she's not going to give.

We don't have time for this.

"Egret," I say quietly.

Dead silence. Yeah, that got her attention.

"An airfleet is approaching the Embassy Base. *Ours.* They violated the ident zone without prior notification, in violation of our diplomatic protocols. It looks like they're going to pull a last-minute course correction; if they do, it puts them on course to surround the base."

For a moment, she doesn't respond. Then: "Do you know what kind of planes they are?"

I suppress the urge to answer with a snippy "You tell me." "Not planes," I say instead. "Shatterhawks."

"Hazel. Conference call," Egret instructs, ripping through a list of names and titles faster than I could have taken down. "Rouse them and get them online; I don't care what it takes. This is pri' violet."

Violet. The only higher priority code is *ultraviolet*, and protocol dictates it only be used in truly exceptional emergencies-atop-emergencies, where already active pri-violet cases are getting in the way of a prompt response to something dire. "On red" was our shorthand for "as soon as possible" back in the Army. "On violet" was "right this fucking instant" and it was rarely spoken calmly.

At least she's taking this mess seriously.

"Patching in Air Marshal Spring-Lotus," Hazel chirps. ""

A gruff male voice. "Comrade President. Comrade General."

"Comrade Marshal." Egret's voice is stiff. "We need to know what is going on at Location Verdant."

"Nothing, as far as I'm aware, ma'am."

"Check again. Where's our nearest aircraft to Verdant Bastion?"

A pause, some distant chatter. "Sable Bastion Two-Nine-Twelve, distance three-oh-seven klicks. It's an old Packhorse, carrying med tech to those holdouts we're trying to curry favor with," he replies, a note of disdain and irritation in his voice. Egret had wanted to overrun the Khmai nationalists and put them down by force, and the military was, for once, behind her 100%; if I hadn't put my foot down there would have been a bloodbath. Politically it wasn't a controversial call, I had the public's backing -- but internally, it cooled some of the enthusiasm certain quarters had for me. Marshal Spring-Lotus was probably one of them. Here's hoping he'll be professional, but wasting time on an emergency call so he could bitch and moan to the President -- so far, I'm not impressed with the man.

"And it's alone?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Marshal, I'm being told there are Shatterhawks menacing Society airspace. Kestrel, how many?"

"Thirty."

"Th-that must be a radar glitch. How have you identified these craft?"

Lifuin breaks in. "IFF is broadcasting. The codes check out for the craft type."

"Ambassador Lifuin Cirsadi," I interject, for the Marshal's benefit. Maybe to intimidate him a little.

A sound like the Marshal is scratching his beard. "Those must be forged codes, ma'am. You'd have to rip out an IFF module to get a live one; we take those things seriously."

*Ass-covering? This is your first priority, at a time like this?*

"The codes *are* live, Marshal," Lifuin responds. I've been with the People long enough now to notice the subtle cadences in her voice that tell me she isn't much impressed with the man either. "The signatures are valid and the key fingerprints are as bound to various Shatterhawks in your database." A dangerous note slips into her voice. "Or at least, in the version you share with us."

A moment of stunned silence. "That-- that can't be right."

"Marshal," Egret says imperiously, "how many Shatterhawks can you account for?"

There's a long pause, filled only by indistinct voices, slowly rising into alarmed shouts. "Fuck," the Marshal breathes.

"Marshal. *What in Shuharva's name is going on?"*

"Unclear at this time." The Marshal sounds shaken. "Thirty 'Hawks are unaccounted for at Gilt Bastion. Th-the Shadowed Gorge hangars."


"Egret. I need your permission to make a call."

"You're asking *me* for *permission?"* She sounds simultaneously taken aback and amused.

"No," I growl. "I'm *telling* you *how to save face."*

"Now *that's* the Kestrel we know and…" She trails off, sighs. "Very well. I *will* hold you to account for the lives of those pilots, General. The materiel is yours to dispose of."

The Marshal sounds alarmed. "Comrade President — those 'Hawks are some of the most valuable tech in our possession, they're effectively a strategic asset—"

"Your advice is noted, Comrade Marshal," Egret says coolly. The Marshal falls silent.


"Ambassador!" Nishuin bows deeply. "Thank you for seeing me."

"No trouble." I beckon. "Come in?"

She shakes her head. "I would not trouble you! I had only a brief question regarding a potentially sensitive matter -- if I might?"

"Shoot."

"Your nudity taboo—"

Ohh no.

"—does it extend to bathing? Showering, to be precise? In the company of others?"

I pinch the bridge of my nose, exhaling deeply. *I should have seen this coming.*

"How bad is it?"

"Mm." Nishuin purses her lips unhappily. "Perhaps it would be best if I were to show you."

I step out into the hall and close the door behind me. "I suppose I should have clued in over the lack of washrooms in our bedr— our dormitories."

Nishuin nods. "Of course, our guest suites—" Her gesture encompasses the common area its the surrounding facilities "—are each equipped with a full complement of private amenities for the sake of visiting embassies and personnel." She looks pained. "Alas, the notion of 'privacy' has distinctly dissimilar implications by our reckoning and yours. To wit…" She indicates the white door ahead of us, next to the bathroom stalls. Apart from a vertical strip of light wood down the left side that houses the handle, the whole door is made of a sheer, foggy substance that lets light filter through, but gives only the faintest impression of what lies beyond. Atop the glass there's an abstract pastel painting of a rainstorm, a nude figure standing on a distant hill with her back turned and wringing out her hair.

All the ornamentation I've seen here is so incredibly out of place, something ostentatious in an otherwise austere facility. More than anything else, as different as the art style is, it still reminds me of the Zyahua mansions, temples, and monasteries I visited in the course of my civilian career, back before we changed the world. It doesn't seem very "Society" to expend so much effort on something as trivial as marking a door. I would have expected something more like the slapdash semi-literate glyphs we used to label places of interest in the barracks, just… simpler. And smug somehow. Was the ornamentation Nishuin's idea? Hoping to make us feel comfortable and respected? 

The actual effect is incredibly intimidating, like at any moment a towering, fiery-tongued dowager is about to round the corner and scold me for not taking my sandals off.




"Bear, Jay, and me---"
