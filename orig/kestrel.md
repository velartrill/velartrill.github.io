"Do you even *understand* what would happen if you took point on the wrong mission and wound up with a magbolt through your stubborn skull or, God within, I don't know, had your guts splattered all over your subordinates by one of those… those bombs with the big 'foe' glyph on one side?" Egret Silverdawn jabs her finger into my aching ribcage and I grunt. The medic snatches her wrist and glances at me. I shake my head weakly, and he releases her, backing away with an I'm-watching-you glare.

"Claymores, Egret," I tell her in a hoarse whisper, staring at the ceiling. "They're called 'claymores.'"

"A claymore. What*ever!"* Egret clutches her forehead. "Kestrel. Darling. I understand your nigh-paraphilic need to be a… a trashy war novel action hero at all times, but there is *more here at stake* than just *you and your team--*"

I sigh. The dim lights of the triage facility sway in the rafters above as a shockwave from a distant explosion rattles the building. The shelling hasn't let up for hours. "Did you. Really come all the way down here. Just to--"

*"What do you think."* Egret squeezes the bridge of her nose. A dazzling flash shatters the night outside the western windows and a wall of noise slams the makeshift hospital, kicking up clouds of dust and sending civilian personnel reflexively diving for cover. Egret doesn't even blink. "What is this, three broken ribs? Shrapnel lacerations all over your thighs? Contusions bigger than my own *skull?* Do you even realize how close you came to *death* today, *Commander?"*

"Wagbeak, I swear-- on Matikhe's s-*sainted* balls--" I turn in astonishment at the sound of the voice. Spar's *sitting up* somehow, glaring daggers at Egret, leaning heavily on her good arm. "The Commander--"

*"Lieutenaaant!"* The horrified medic rushes to Sparrow's bed and tries to press her gently back down again. "I told you, you need to *lay on your back*--"

"S'*fine*, doc, I'll walk it off."

"Walk it--? You most certainly will *not!* Get your head back on that pillow or so help me I'll have you strapped *down,* Lieutenant."

"Jeez, leas' buy me dinner first--"

"Your survival is *critical* to troop morale. Imagine if Cormorant--" Egret swallows "--if some ill befell *her,* how long do you think it would take the for the whole front to collapse? Hm? Because you're nearly as important to the troops, the one thing keeping them from feeling quite so hideously outnumbered and outgunned as they are, and--"

I pull my blankets more tightly around me. The shivering is getting bad; I nearly bit into my tongue just now. "I lived, didn't I?" I mutter. "Egret, what in *ash* are you even doing this close to the line of contact--"

"That. Is. Not. The. *Point!"* Egret practically shouts. She steps closer, unblinking eyes fixed on mine, her voice a low hiss. "Will you for *once* set the bravado asi--"

"Mistress Silverdawn," the medic interjects acidly, "some *respect* for the wounded, if you would. The Commander--"

"--is a *professional,* *comrade*," Egret retorts without looking up. She aims a finger at my chest. *"This* is in any case entirely *self*-inflicted; bravery is commedable to be sure, but *do not conflate bravery with stupidity!*"

*"Comrade Silverdawn.* I understand you are close with the Cormorant but if you think that will stop me from having you thrown out of this facility--"

*"Sir!"* The door to the ward clatters open and an assistant bursts in, eyes wild. "Sir, orders from the General. We're to evacuate at once."

"Evacu--*what!?*" The medic is taken completely aback. "What are you--"

*"Den tsuang* just took the eastern gate. Sir, we have maybe ten minutes if we're lucky, they're advancing down the Causeway behind a wall of artillery. They'll have the whole Khmai Quarter under fire control soon--"

"God*dammit!*" The medic slams a fist against a support pillar. "That's not nearly enough time-- what are we--"

"Orders are, everyone too busted up to fight goes to the Witherbrook cargo depot by the underground. They're sending as many trams as they can spare but anyone who misses the transport at Witherbrook is going to be left facing the Guard advance."

"How are we supposed to get two hundred and twenty-nine *bedbound patients* onto a God-damn rail car? In *ten minutes!?*"

"Don't you w-w-worry about me, doc," Sparrow calls out, trying to sit up again. "Get the others out, I'll help the rest buy you time--"

"You will do *nothing of the sort,* Fenwild!" I blurt, my lungs burning and my legs spasming involuntarily. "You're a goddamn c-c-combat liability right now and you are not stepping one *foot* closer to the front line."

*"Thank you,"* the medic breathes, patting me on the arm. He points at Sparrow. "If you're this dead-set on being suicidally helpful then *help us get the patients to the underground."*

"If that's where I can do the most good--"

"It is. Go with Amaryllis and follow his instructions." The medic turns, glowering at Egret. "As for you, woman, get--"

"Sparrow." Egret turns away from the medic, as though he has simply ceased to exist. She beckons. "Help me with the stretcher."

"Just what do you think you're--" the medic bursts out. Sparrow looks hesitantly between the two of them.

Egret doesn't even look up as she replies, frantically buckling the straps over my shoulders, chest, and legs. "This woman is too important for me to trust you with her. *Sparrow!"*

"There is a *protocol,* Silverdawn--"

"And I wish you *best of luck with it,*" Egret growls, as Sparrow, wincing, takes hold of the top of my stretcher. "Now get out of our way!"

"Egret," I choke out, "don't, don't interfere--"

"You know the most unfair thing, Kestrel?" Egret asks, her voice uncharacteristically soft, and I whimper as my stretcher rises into the air. "If you die in action, *you don't have to explain yourself to her afterwards.*"

---

The last few years have been a contest of wills between the Ambassador and the Commander. My military instincts are too burned into my brain to fade on their own, and I figure the only way I'll ever be able to pass for a normal human being again is wrestling my past into submission. But I have to choose my battles, so today I don't waste willpower fighting my urge to lead from the front -- an urge that is no less strong in what is probably the most secure place on our little planet. *They might turn on us at any moment,* the Commander hisses in my head, but I slap her down with the morning's memories. Little Nishuin alone could probably take me and Jay both with a hand tied behind her back if she had cause, and even Bear wouldn't last five seconds in a room full of Society ethnics. There is simply no preparing for a vanishingly improbable betrayal I have no means to mitigate in the slightest.

And all the same I'm the first to step into the room, reflexively casing it before I can get my brain back under control. A gentle breeze hits my face; one wall is open to the elements, and a translucent roof casts the wood paneling of the walls in warm daylight. Plants grow in recesses along the walls, and in the center of the room is a long, curved table wrapping a bit more than halfway around in a circle, with an odd curved slab of glass near the far edge rising out of the desk. In the middle of that circle is a rolling cart piled with what look like… wetsuits? Clearly some sort of garment, though not one I'm familiar with.

"Ambassador Kestrel. Honored comrades." The man standing in the center of the room offers a salute as we enter; I return the gesture almost reflexively. He's dressed in a long black _rancal_ with a white tail, like Soshten's uniform but pinned at the neck with a slim leather collar. "Please, make yourselves comfortable."

I offer Piper a chair before hesitantly seating myself. Nishuin takes up position beside but slightly behind the instructor, her hands clasped demurely at her waist. Part of me expects her to start unrolling a giant illuminated scroll with stroke diagrams, like I'm back in training again, and I feel a brief, ridiculous moment of *oh-no-I-forgot-my-brush-again* panic.

Hopefully diplomatic privilege extends to not being flogged in front of the class.

As we sit, the man in front of us bows deeply. "Welcome, all. I am Nalshan of the Sarsavi Ninth, instructor of space cadets at Tel Casran. I will be responsible for ensuring you achieve Green Sash proficiencies critical to space travel such as microgravity navigation and shipboard safety procedure."

I incline my head. "Thank you, Nalshan-*surin*." I can't help but smirk at the startled look on his face. "It is a pleasure to meet you. Shall we go over names briefly for your sake?"

"I have previously familiarized myself with your staff," Nalshan says with a soft smile. "That will not be necessary."

"Ah!" I laugh awkwardly. "I keep forgetting we all have files. We are very grateful for your time and assistance, comrade."

"Think nothing of it." Nalshan waves dismissively, then clasps his hands behind his back. "Before we commence, I must give you a warning I am certain you have already heard here far too many times -- while I was selected by my superiors for my fluency in your common-tongue, my work has henceforth been exclusively among the People: I am a military planner, not a diplomat, and my knowledge of your culture is negligible. Thus I may not be as effective an instructor as I would wish, much as it shames me; I humbly ask that you forgive any unintentional offense or miscommunication on my part.

"For reasons of safety, your liaison Nishuin will of course be present during all sessions of this course; her role is to monitor and correct as necessary to ensure the language barrier does not lead to miscommunication of critical procedure, and will co-certify your proficiencies at the end of this course.

"Now -- are there any questions regarding your upcoming course of study before we begin? "

Jay hesitantly raises a hand. Nalshan inclines his head to her. "Comrade Jay."

"Instructor Nalshan, sir." Poor Jay looks -- and sounds -- so painfully incongruous out of uniform. "What is the length of this course, sir?"

"That depends entirely on the students. Until you each are certified at Green Sash or higher, our regulations absolutely prohibit you from boarding any Society-sovereign spacecraft, absent emergencies requiring interplanetary evacuation." Nalshan's eyes twinkle. "In ordinary circumstances I would be entirely confident in my ability to raise you each to Green by the time the next starship arrives -- however, alas, you are foreign dignitaries, not cadets subject to military discipline, and this restrains me considerably."

"If I may, sir, I would request that you disregard—" Jay glances at me "—diplomatic niceties, as far as I am concerned. My job is keeping my Ambassador safe, and I would respectfully request that you treat me no differently than any ordinary cadet under your command."

Nalshan laughs. "Well! In that case I'm fairly certain you at least will easily meet the deadline." He glances at the rest of us. "Would any others care to join with Comrade Jay?"

"Bear and I will," I announce. "Please disregard any diplomatic privilege that might get in the way of doing your job. I will warn you if you cross a line; until then do not let our status trouble you." Jay gives me a respectfully exasperated look; I smile brightly back at her.

"You're passing as a civilian extra well today," Bear says in a low, amused whisper, pinching my thigh under the table.

"M-me too." I turn in surprise. Piper is holding up her hand hesitantly. Nalshan raises an eyebrow at the trembling waif, and glances around the room again. A few other hands grudgingly rise as well. I massage the bridge of my nose to hide a smirk.

*Wagbeak is going to* love *you, sweetheart.*

"Understood and noted." Nalshan nods approvingly. "I appreciate your dedication and the trust you're putting in me by voluntarily placing yourselves under military discipline. I will do my utmost to exceed your expectations. As for those of you who are not comfortable doing so, I hope you will not feel judged or diminished, as this is not a competition -- the optimal way to learn is generally the one you are most comfortable with. Nevertheless, I do respectfully ask that you keep your comrades in mind and dedicate yourselves seriously to the task at hand, to avoid any unnecessary flight delays or crew separation. —Comrade Bear, you have questions?"

"Could you give us a quick rundown of the curriculum?" Bear rumbles. "So we've some idea what to expect over the next moon or so."

"Of course! The first unit will be strictly ground-based. You will be outfitted with and trained in the operation of your safety gear, and any last-minute tailoring issues will be corrected." Nalshan indicates the garments on the cart. "Once you have acceptable proficiency in voidskin operation, we will begin easing you into orbital ascent, then microgravity. Once you are comfortable in a microgravity environment-- and getting to that point is a somewhat… intestinally traumatic experience, I regret to relate -- we will start on microgravity navigation techniques, protocol, and etiquette. Finally, you will learn how to respond rapidly to a variety of shipboard emergencies; the final test will involve patching a live hull breach and putting out a fire in orbit."

"A… live hull breach?" says Piper, eyes slightly unfocused.

"It is a very limited course, trimmed down to the absolute bare necessities," Nalshan replies. "Ordinarily I would never let anyone loose in space until they'd earned their red sash, and were proficient in micro- and variable-gravity combat, system and stellar comms, and emergency shift-drive operation. *However,* for reasons of security and simple relevance, the vast majority of course material will be omitted."

"Vast… *majority!?"*

"Additionally, as our training regimens are intended for military personnel, they ordinarily involve an element of low-level risk which diplomatic personnel certainly cannot be exposed to--"

"A live *hull breach?* That's not *risky!?*" babbles Piper. I lean over to put a hand on her back before she starts hyperventilating.

"Of course not!" Nalshan laughs. "Never fear. We tune our exercises to ensure— well, let me give you an example. What's your maximum PX? I imagine it's a bit low with your *uasdani* physiology but--"

"Maximum *what!?*"

"Ah, forgive my slang. I mean perceptual accel--"

"Instructor," says Nishuin softly.

Nalshan stops, and turns. "...was that, ah -- too intimate of a question?" he asks, reddening slightly.

"Nalshan-_surin_. At-will PX is not a capability found in baselines."

Nalshan blinks. He glances around the room. "And you're... all baselines? All of you? Ah, do forgive me if that is an inappropriate--"

"There is only one known non-baseline clade among the lawful Imperial population and it is vanishingly rare," Nishuin interrupts. "I would be surprised if there was so much as a single Rohara on this planet; there are certainly none in the room. Baseline perceptual acceleration is an involuntary response dependent on stress-activated neurotransmitters such as adrenaline; it is unpredictable, impossible to maintain for more than a brief period, harmful to the body, and even then they top out at arround factor six. I do not even know if they are able to operate at full intellectual capacity in that state, and they do not even have the physical strength to accelerate their movement along with their cognition. It is therefore *most* inadvisable to rely on their primitive PX mechanism in life-or-death matters."

Nalshan stares at her. *"Sixfold?* Are you serious?"

"Even that is uncommonly high."

Nalshan blinks several times. "I… I see. Clearly certain aspects of the training regimen will need to be… revised."

*"Thank you thank you thank you,"* I mouthe at Nishuin. God, her training wasn't completely useless after all! She smiles back at me.

Slowly, Nalshan turns back to us, looking slightly dazed. "I… hm. Breach drills are an absolute requirement for space travel, *but* we, ah, have a surgeon on staff who is a specialist in _uasdani_ physiology. I will consult with her and Nishuin-comrade to make entirely certain we conduct the drills in a manner that does not expose any of you to physical harm." He glances at me. "I… hope that is acceptable to you, Ambassador-comrade?"

"I will need to look over the specific plans for the drills myself," I answer. He nods, looking relieved.

"Of course. That will not be a problem. Ah, yes, Comrade Jay?"

"So, hypothetically, sir--" Jay tents her fingers absently. "If some of us were to complete… green level, yes? -- with enough time left over, would it be possible for those interested to receive some of that, uh… 'superfluous' training?"

"Oh!" Nalshan looks both surprised and excited, like a girl who's just unexpectedly bumped into her soulmate on the tram. "Well! I… certainly could provide elective training in additional safety drills, though combat training is… mm, I would have to clear that with my superiors as that training is restricted material. It's not likely they'd assent, even to an ally — and, well, frankly, to be realistic with you, our courses are geared toward *randani* physiology, so I'm unsure to what extent you could safely—"

Jay holds up her hands. "If I may, sir. I'm interested in whatever other training you may be able to provide. If you can supply me with a list of what you're allowed to offer at some point, I would be very grateful. And as far as safety is concerned, I'll sign whatever waivers are necessary. Sir."

Nalshan looks helplessly at Nishuin. "W-waivers?" Nishuin sighs.

"A cognitive artifact of their former transactional economy. Under such systems duties of care and liabilities towards another may be vacated at the acquiescence of she to whom the care is owed. A waiver is the legal instrument which formalizes such an acquiescence; it is simply a specific kind of covenant." Nishuin turns to Jay. "Please forgive us, honored comrade. Under the Charter, consent is largely irrelevant to matters of responsibility, especially where grievous harm may result. Nalshan will be held responsible for your life and safety during void training regardless of what you may personally will. I realize this may be disappointing and perhaps insulting to you; I can only offer my deeply sincere apologies."

"…o-oh." Jay looks down. "I see. I apologize if I was out of line."

"You were not!" Nishuin assures her.

"Thank you for being so understanding and accomodating. I have no further questions, sir."

"I'll get you that list as soon as I can." Nalshan glances about the room. "Now, do any of you have pre-existing training in space safety protocol, microgravity combat, any other related proficiencies?"

"We don't have our own deepvoid assets yet," I interject quietly. "Right now the League is providing our system security under treaty; we ourselves are prioritizing reconstruction and planetside infrastructure deployment."

"Ah! I see. Please pardon my ignorance. But, in a way, this is all to the best," Nalshan adds. "Our training regime differs markedly from that of the various spacefaring League powers, due to both the technological gap between us and a more stringent adherence to procedure on our part. In this way, pre-existing proficiencies can be more of a hindrance than an asset." He clasps his hands. "Now, can anyone name the most important dangers void travel poses to human life? --Comrade Ash." He gestures to the Khmai boy.

"Decompression, suffocation, and radation, I believe, sir. And slavers."

"In priority order no less! Very good, you only missed one: overheating. The void is a very rigorous environment that poses extreme challenges to the human body, and the baseline body most of all. In some ways it's actually more difficult just to keep people alive in the void than to travel between worlds in the first place. Obviously, that's the function of voidcraft, and after uncountable millennia of human void travel, we've gotten pretty good at it.

"However, even the best-designed voidcraft can't account for every eventuality. Who can tell me the primary function of voidship armor?"

"Surviving combat?" asks Bear suspiciously. Nalshan grins.

"In fact, no! That is actually only a secondary function, and a very distant second at that. No, the primary function of ship armor is to protect the ship and its occupants against *debris.* The velocities you reach in the void are unlike anything you'll experience planetside. A railgun round is slow by comparison to a cruising ship. And at those velocity differentials, even small objects can cause a devastating impact. Interstellar probes that travel outside the hyperspace volume have to be coated with gigantic wedges of ice in the direction of travel, because relativistic velocity is so extreme that even a collision with a *particle of dust* could hit with the force of an atom bomb.

"Mercifully, traversing known space requires much lower velocities thanks to shift drive. Spacefaring civilizations also develop networks of standard routes through their inhabited systems, establishing stargates, jump points, drivewebs, and interplanetary lanes that are carefully monitored and kept clear of debris. However, even so, hull breaches *will* occur from time to time, particularly in old systems that have seen substantial warfare over the millennia. If you're very unfortunate you might even hit a live munition from a war than ended ten thousand years ago. This means that ultimately, the ship itself is sacrificial." He points to Ash and I. "Ultimately it's just a protective layer around the passengers -- around you. You can't count on the protections of the ship itself to keep you alive in all circumstances. Oxygen reclamation, heat reradiation, the hull and rad shielding -- these can all fail in various ways.

"Now, consider those dangers we just listed. Decompression, suffocation, overheating, radiation poisoning. These have something in common: outside extreme cases, none will be immediately lethal. You will have time to react, and potentially, if I do my job right, address the danger so it becomes survivable. However, that time can sometimes be measured in seconds, and you have to make every second count. Does anyone know how long an unprotected human baseline can survive direct exposure to hard vacuum?" He glances around. "Fifteen seconds. That's how long someone *else* has to rescue you, assuming you overcome your instincts and vent your lungs in time. You yourself will have only *seconds* to react before you lose consciousness. And if you *don't* vent your lungs, a sufficiently rapid drop in pressure will lead to internal ruptures that will leave you *unable to get oxygen from air* even if you are rescued -- at that point, the only way to keep you alive will be direct venous infusion of oxygen until you can be delivered to a red-level reconstruction center equipped to grow and implant new alveoli in your lungs. Or replace your lungs outright, if the damage is severe enough. That's not even getting into the severe damage that would occur to nonvital organs, like your eardrums. And there's no guarantee a baseline will even survive weeks or months of extracorporeal oxygenation, though obviously we would do everything in our considerable power.

"This is where voidskins come in." Nalshan touches the cart. "Voidskins serve many different functions, but at their core, they're a fallback layer of armor between you and the void." He lifts up a suit, letting it unfold. It's made of a slick, black, reflective material, unnaturally smooth, with the emblem of the Society on the upper arms and a sequence of glyphs above the breast. "When things go wrong in the void, this garment is what will keep you alive. Now, I want to be *very* clear, this is *not* a full hardplate. It can't deploy a helm when pressure drops and it can't save you if you're sucked out into the void without one. The point of wearing a voidskin is simply to buy you time, whether that's to patch a hull breach, don an emergency helmet, get into your armor, or shoot some bastard dead. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you're automatically safe just because you're wearing one of these.

"The most important functionality of a voidskin day-to-day is its simplest: the rad barrier. There's a thin osmium-based metamaterial lining that limits your exposure to a wide spectrum of ionizing emissions, most particularly gamma rays and X-rays. Even if your trip goes exactly as planned, a small amount of ionizing radiation will still penetrate your ship's hull. A secondary layer that protects most of your body volume directly -- and we've done studies on this -- will dramatically decrease your chance of developing cancer and needing complicated, specialized medical treatment to root it out. The longer you spend in space, the more important it is to wear a voidskin at all times. Obviously it doesn't protect your head and brain above your neck, but those are a much smaller target, and among even long-term Society ship crew cerebral and oral cancers aren't much more common than lung cancer. Comrade Piper?"

"We have to wear those the whole time we're in space, sir?"

"That's correct, cadet."

Piper reddens slightly. "Can't we wear more… normal clothing?"

"Of course you can. You just have to wear it on top of your voidskin. In practice, though, most of our personnel eventually stop wearing anything but their suit when they're offworld; most ordinary clothing--" he touches his *rancal* for emphasis "--is very impractical in microgravity and in terms of heat redistribution. However, if it makes you feel more comfortable, you can absolutely wear your *rancal* on top; no one will make fun of you."

Piper bites her lip. "O-okay."

"In addition to the rad guard, your suit has many more sophisticated features." He taps the arm of the suit he's holding. "Every part of this suit is made of a smart material than can tighten and loosen in real time. Have any of you ever worn a flightsuit?"

Willow raises his hand. He was a scout, and later flew medevacs in the Batterwinds District campaign, I think. Kid saved probably near as many lives as I did, and do they call him a hero for it?

No, because he did it without killing anyone.

Nalshan nods to him. "What's the purpose of a flightsuit, Comrade Willow?"

"As I understand it, sir, it applies pressure to the extremities to prevent too much blood from flowing out of the brain and causing you to black out during high-G maneuvers."

"Absolutely correct, cadet. You can think of voidskins as similar, except they can react to your body and your acceleration in real time. Wearing one of these, you can endure dramatically higher acceleration while completely conscious. Now, ordinarily that kind of acceleration, you're only going to encounter that in combat, but -- well, I'm getting ahead of myself.

"The thing about the baseline body is it evolved, as far as we can tell, in a mid-grav environment. Your biology, and to a lesser extent mine, is dependent on gravity for a number of functions, and is 'calibrated' for a certain level of gravity depending on your race. Kaparttu, for instance, are less comfortable on higher-grav worlds than Zyahua. Now, void travel poses a problem because for much of the trip, you will either be in microgravity or accelerating at a lower G than your race is accustomed to." He holds up his arm, straining his sleek biceps so they bulge slightly up from his skin. Out of the corner of my eye I notice Jay, of all people, blushing and looking down. "One of the biggest problems you'll face is muscle loss. You need far less muscle power to function and navigate in the void than you do on any planet, and your body *will* notice that. So given enough time it'll decide it doesn't need the muscles anymore and reabsorb them. Then you land on a planet and you're just crushed by gravity; you can barely lift your arms against it, let alone walk."

"Voidwalker disease, we call it," Bear murmurs.

"There are various countermeasures that can be applied. I understand in the Empire it's common for stations and the more expensive ships to have segments that rotate to provide simulated gravity. This tends to be a poor and unpleasant imitation of the real thing; the People consider simulgrav wasteful and use a more elegant solution." He lifts the arm of the suit. "Your suit is calibrated to your planet of origin and its gravity level. It contains resistive fibers, quite like muscles themselves, which react when you move a limb, and provide the appropriate level of resistance or assistance depending on your orientation. Most importantly it applies resistance to your chest, so that your lung muscles don't atrophy -- otherwise you might get home and suffocate when you try to lie down. Ah, Comrade Nishuin?"

"For the women among you, the suit also comfortably restrains your breasts to hold them in place regardless of your activity level," Nishuin interjects. "I understand this can prevent a great deal of pain for baselines. Additionally, living in low gravity is like routine use of supportive garments; it can cause your breasts to sag over time. Your voidskins will limit this as well by replicating the effects of gravity on your breasts to the greatest possible extent."

"I learn something new every day. Thank you, comrade." Nalshan turns back to us. "Additionally, the suits contain a venous interface system that can briefly supply emergency oxygen -- longer, with an external hookup -- and purge potentially lethal buildups of carbon dioxide, or other inert gases for that matter. This works by deploying micro-needles that pierce your skin and connect your veins to the filtration apparatus. --The winces are warranted, believe me; it's exactly as painful and unpleasant as it sounds, and once the needles have been deployed, you shouldn't try to remove your suit without a medic assisting you. But I promise you it's worth it -- if shipboard oxygen reclamation fails or the atmosphere is purged, your suit and helmet will, with enough power, keep you alive until the system can be repaired. Voidskins are impermeable to gas, and the gloves -- which I encourage you to wear at all times and remove only when necessary -- form an airtight seal. If you already have your suit and gloves on, all you need to go is pull on a helm, which will seal automatically, and you will be fully protected from both decompression and suffocation. And that only takes a second or two, compared to the thirty seconds or so it takes to suit up, even with practice.

"In order to help navigate in a microgravity environment, your suit has a number of strong electromagnets, in the feet, the hands, and down the back. For instance, you can activate the foot-magnets to let you walk along a metal surface, or set them in repulsor mode to push off from that same surface.

"Finally, there is the issue of overheating. Voidskins use thermoelectric fabrics to purge heat from the body. Many cadets object to the prospect of wearing a skintight suit and gloves for extended periods because they worry it will make them hot and sweaty. In fact, your suit can be precisely adjusted to maintain the level of internal temperature you find most comfortable. You can even set different temperatures for different parts of your body. So don't worry about discomfort. I've found that many long-term ship crew actually get so used to this luxury they even wear their voidskins planetside. On their own, voidskins cannot radiate heat particularly effectively in a vacuum; however, their climate-control system integrates with hardsuit heat exchangers for EVA."

"Of course, there's a lot of extra functionality we've crammed into these things over the centuries, mostly convenience functions, but what I've described are the parts you need to know about and the parts you'll be trained and tested on. Keep in mind that most of these features are quite high-energy. Since most of you are significantly taller than than your typical *randanin* you actually have a bit of an advantage here; your suits have more room for battery polymer. On average, assuming no emergencies and minimal use of the magnav features, your suit's batteries should last about 32 hours, but you should always make sure you recharge it whenever you sleep. In all shipboard sleeping quarters, as well as your quarters here in the embassy, you'll find a dock by your bed with flex-fabric cuffs that are wired up to the ship's power grid. All you have to do to slip a cuff around your wrist and your suit will begin charging by induction. There are induction receptors on both wrists, ankles, and on the neck; you can use any one of these or even more than one at a time if you need to recharge your suit more quickly. Your suit will warn you with a painful jolt to the right wrist if the battery is running dangerously low. Do *not* let your batteries run out. It could very well cost you your life.

"Every day when you come to class I *will* check to make sure you remembered to recharge your suit overnight and you will be disciplined if you forget. Or, if you haven't consented to military discipline, I *will* shake my head and go 'tsk-tsk' at you in front of the whole class, which may well be worse. I once reduced a triumvir to tears with a disapproving look." He grins. "Alright. Hopefully by now I've convinced you that void travel is serious business, and not to take off your voidskin without a damned good reason."


"The consequence of this is that our volume is much emptier. There are vanishingly few stargates, no common routes, you're not likely to encounter any other voidcraft, and it's very, very unlikely that anyone will be able to respond in time if you launch a distress beacon. This means you need to take everything you might need on a journey with you -- things like medical equipment, redundant critical hardware, replacement parts, and so on. Most importantly: firepower.

"You may be surprised to learn that the emptiness of our volume means it's still 'wild,' and therefore actually much more dangerous than League or even Imperial volumes. You never know when you might encounter slavers or pirates. You can't protect yourself simply by 'sticking to the beaten path,' as there is none. You can only protect yourself by carrying a bigger gun than the other guy.

"This means, regrettably, we're going to have to talk about combat. Even though none of you will be involved in any aspect of combat unless, all fortune forfend, your ship is actually *boarded,* you still need to be prepared for combat procedures because they affect everyone onboard.

"Another vital purpose of your voidskin is to warn you of exceptional circumstances. The constrictor bands and electrodes will be provide a gentle, silent 'jolt' to your body, and most importantly can physically wake you up if you're asleep. Does anyone know why this is important? Comrade Ash."

"I assume you purge atmosphere before combat, sir?"

"Exactly so. The unfortunate thing about human physiology is we breathe glorified rocket fuel. A pressurized, oxygenated ship environment is great for comfort, but it's the absolute deadliest weakness when people are shooting at you. Any kind of hull puncture can cause rapid depressurization, which is deadly enough on its own, but there's something worse."

"Thermobarics," says Jay in a quiet voice, like someone who's just been shown a pile of corpses without warning. I flinch, realization dawning. Nishvir nods solemnly.

"That's it exactly. Thermobaric weapons are usually fired in the opening salvo of any conflict between void-craft, especially if you can take the enemy by surprise. If you hit them before they've purged atmo, that's it, it's over. A wall of fire will gut their ship from the inside out. Only ships with discrete atmosphere compartments stand a chance of surviving even one hit intact.

"So if your ship is attacked or combat seems to impend, ship atmosphere will be rapidly vented and drained to high-pressure storage tanks throughout the vessel. Without your suit to alert you and wake you up to don a helm, you would likely suffocate in your sleep -- it's impossible to sustain consciousness below a certain level of pressure. Depending on your phase of sleep the ship's sonic alarms *might* be able to wake you in time, but an electric jolt to the nerves will wake you from anything short of a coma."



"Well, enough talking. It's time for you to actually learn how to don and remove your voidskins." Nalshan clasps his hands. "If you would disrobe and--"

Nishuin actually grabs him by the shoulder, eyes wide. "Comrade, that is not advisable," she blurts, holding up a hand to us in a placating gesture. Nalshan blinks.

"Forgive me, what is the matter?"

"The Imperial cultures have a very strong taboo on interpersonal nudity. This was… an issue, yesterday."

"An 'issue?'"

"We are fortunate not to have caused a diplomatic incident."

Nalshan's eyes widen. "Well now. That presents a problem -- Ambassador, I assume requiring your staff to undress as a group would be, as you say, 'crossing a line?'"

"Yes," I reply immediately. "Very much so."

"Perhaps -- hm. *We've* no objection to nudity, so perhaps a demonstration would suffice, and your people could then dress themselves privately -- Comrade Nishuin, could I enlist you briefly?"

"Of course! It would be my pleasure to be of use. I'll fetch my suit directly…" Nishuin turns, then hesitates and turns back to me. "Hm. Comrade Ambassador, forgive me for again touching on such a sensitive topic, but your culture's nudity taboo -- is it a matter of discomfort with your own nudity, or do you feel uncomfortable in the presence of others who are nude?"

"Raise your hand if you object to seeing Comrade Nishuin naked," I call out. Bear bursts out laughing. Piper immediately blushes and Jay flashes Nishuin an over-the-top sleazy grin. No one puts up their hand. "You have your answer, comrade," I tell the girl.

"Oh, good!" exclaims Nishuin, clasping her hands. "I do so appreciate your tolerance. I shall return momentarily."

"She is so innocent," Bear murmurs to me. "It's adorable."

"Ma'am, what's our embassy policy on catcalling our hosts?" Jay asks me as Nishuin slips out of the room.

I can't suppress a little laugh. "Hold off until our cultural attaché gets me a report on the topic."

"Copy that, ma'am." Jay touches her brow. Bear rumbles with laughter, nudging me with an elbow.

"Aren't you your own cultural attaché at this point, *Kestrel-*_surin_?"

"I've got leave *something* for poor Piper to cut her teeth on."

Nalshan clears his throat. "Now that you mention it -- since I cannot discuss course material until our Liaison returns, perhaps we can take advantage of this downtime for some casual discussion, sate one another's curiosity somewhat. How does that sound?"

"Well, I've got something I'm curious about," says Bear after a moment. "If these void-suit things are so fancy, why do you only wear them in space? If I had my own personal climate control I could just carry around with me, I don't think I'd ever want to put it down."

"'Voidskin' is a bit of an archaism, I suppose," replies Nalshan. "Keeping void travellers safe was the original purpose of the design, but it has been so expanded and streamlined and so many new capabilities added that the garment has become useful planetside as well. To answer your question, many of us do make casual use of voidskins; they are common outdoor wear on particularly hot or cold days, and they are worn for extra protection when camping in wild regions. Particularly in the Colonies, as they are much wilder and more sparsely populated. They are also useful when swimming for extended periods or in dangerously cold waters, and they are of course a standard part of fighter pilot duty dress. 

"However, the *rancal* remains our preferred form of clothing, for most. Partly as a matter of tradition, partly because we tend to prefer lighter, less concealing garments. Voidskins cover the body in a way that hampers intimacy and dulls exterior sensations. Wind and rain on our bodies, the heat of the sun, and so forth. We prefer not to be cut off from nature when it is not necessary. Additionally, voidskins are *terribly* expensive to construct and repair, and while they're reasonably sturdy we prefer to avoid taking the risk of damaging them when possible.


"I'm going to hand out your suits and your wrist consoles. Keep in mind, voidskins are tailored from the ground up to a specific individual and are *never* interchangeable -- this is part of why it's mandatory to wear yours at all times; we can't just stock emergency kits with them. Wristcons are completely interchangeable and if yours is damaged, you can just swap it out for a functional one, or share a single functional unit with a partner."



"Is there really…" Piper's cheeks are beet red. "This is *really* tight, couldn't I get something that fits, y'know, a little better? Sir?"

"This *is* a perfect fit for a voidskin, cadet," Nalshan replies. "In order to be able to function properly it needs to impose a minimum level of pressure uniformly across the body. Otherwise the sensory electrodes can't make contact, the filtration system wouldn't be able to access your veins, the resistance fibers would be useless, and your skin would inflate like a balloon the moment you were exposed to vacuum. Thanks to a certain training accident a few years ago I'm privileged to be able to tell you from firsthand experience, you do not *ever* want to find out what *that* feels like."

Piper's gaze drops. "O-oh. I, um. Okay, sir," she mumbles, squeezing her legs tightly together. "Can we take them off now?"

"I'll show you how to remove them shortly, but as part of your training, you are all required -- or in the case of those of you who have not assented to military discipline, politely requested -- for your own safety to wear your suit at all times from this point forward. Every day I'll get a data dump from your suits and if I spot any miscalibrations, I'll adjust them until we get it right. You need to be accustomed to it by the time we head into orbit, and more importantly we also need to collect a few weeks of baseline biodata on you. We need to make sure your suit's synced properly with your body as well, since none of you have Society-grade health, genetic, and biomorphology records to work from. The suit may feel awkward now, but I promise in a week or two you'll feel naked without it."

Piper looks like she's going to melt from pure embarassment.



"Back on Tel Casran your subordinate would have been flogged in front of the class for that," he observes wryly as my crew files out of the room.

I fold my arms and narrow my eyes. "…I'll allow it," I say after a moment, raising a finger before Nalshan can interject. *"If* they ask nicely first."

Nalshan laughs out loud. "Ambassador. It really is a pity we've only so long to get to know each other."

"Hey now, don't say that," I reply archly. "Surely we've got a few years yet before you manage to certify me."

Nalshan smiles politely. "Fear not, comrade; I have little doubt I'll whip you into shape with time to spare."

"Fair warning. I was held back three whole years at the scribal academy when I was a teenager."

Nalshan moves to look me directly in the eye, and claps a hand to my shoulder. He's rather tall for a Randani, I note. "Challenge accepted, cadet," he says, eyebrows rising and the corner of his lip curling upward. "I hope you have a marvelous afternoon."

"And you." I touch him lightly on the shoulder and bow. "Forgive me. I'd curtsey, but my dress was deemed a national security hazard."

Nalshan nods, deadpan. "Then our nuclear secrets are safe… for now."

I pause on my way out the door, and turn back to him. "Tell me something?"

"Of course."

"Nuclear secrets. Are those really still the most valuable secrets you've got? At your level, I mean?"

Nalshan laughs. "Oh, Ambassador. Answers like that are *well* above my clearance."

I grin. "I had a feeling. See you around, Comrade."

"Please, Ambassador. *Nal* is perfectly fine in the, hm, 'personal context', perhaps?" His eyes twinkle mischievously. "Or *sir* -- whichever makes you more… comfortable."

I raise my eyebrows. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind." I flash him a casual salute. "See you around, sir."


Eventually Jay and I are the last ones left in the tranquil little garden, staring up at the moons. A constant in the night sky my whole life -- it's unsettling to think I won't see them for at least four years of my life.

"You are really serious about protecting me, hey?" I ask Jay softly after a while.

"Ma'am." She doesn't quite stand to attention this time, but I can tell she's fighting her instincts. "If I may, ma'am -- if there is any microgravity combat experience to be found in the Republic, it's among private citizens who've sailed the Void. Mercenaries, relic hunters, adventurers, pirates and slaver scum who've escaped justice, and so on. As things stand our military is in no position to offfer that training -- right now we don't even have a practice platform -- and that means we're behind not only probably the whole damn League but the *den tsuang* as well. I would give my life to protect you without hesitation, ma'am, but I also feel it is urgent to transmit whatever skill and experience I can acquire in this new battlespace to our military so we can get a head start at catching up. Being able to both board and repel is crucial in Void combat, sometimes more so than your own ride surviving the engagement."

I rub my brow tiredly.  A golden new world on the horizon and all she can think of is killing people there. I really want to slap her, if I'm being honest with myself.

But I also know everything she just said made perfect sense and I agree with her assessment in every particular. Probably that's *why* I want to slap her so much.

…I really need to talk to Shalvan about this.

I pat Jay on the shoulder. "Ever the consummate professional, soldier," I tell her.

"Ma'am." A little flicker of a smile at what she apparently interpreted as a compliment.

"Tell me something." I fold my arms, gazing into her eyes. "What do you think of the League? --And yes, before you ask, please, speak freely. Always, when we're one on one."

"Well, ma'am." Jay chews her lip for a moment. "We couldn't have done it without them, ma'am, and I am deeply and profoundly grateful for what they did for our people, and I respect the everlasting fuck out of them, and I don't trust them as far as I could throw their capital star. Ma'am."

I laugh weakly. "I appreciate your analysis and I will keep it in mind."


"And Jay?"

"Ma'am?"

"I'm your Ambassador, not your CO. Military courtesy is really not necessary--"

"With respect, ma'am--"

"Jay, if you're saying it to my face, I already know you mean it with respect--"

"--you are an ambassador but you are also General-for-Life of the Army. I served in and remain on reserve in that same Army and you outrank virtually everyone else in my chain of command, so I do think--"

"You know that job is just a sinecure, right? I'm not *in* your chain of command, because I don't *have* a command--"

Jay looks at me with an expression usually directed far down the business end of the chain. "Ma'am," she says tiredly, "if you gave the order to jump, can you think of a single field officer, noncom, or recruit in the Army, Navy, or Air Force who wouldn't salute and ask 'how high?' with a dopey grin on their face?"

"Khata'e's tits, Jay, I'm not the commander-in-chief--"

"I understand that's a topic of some contention, ma'am. For what it's worth--" Jay fixes me with a look that makes my subconscious *really confused* about who outranks who here "--as far as I'm concerned, Silverd--"

"Lieu*tenant!"* I snap. Jay immediately stands to attention. "For the love of God within do *not* finish that sentence. This is a secure facility but it's not *our* 'secure.' Do you understand?"

Jay takes a sharp breath, finally realizing what she was just about to do. "Ma'am! Yes, ma'am; I apologize, General; it will *not* happen again."

"See that it doesn't, soldier." I pat her on the shoulder, and as I walk past, I lean closer. "I appreciate the sentiment all the same," I whisper with a wink. Jay cracks the tiniest grin.

"Understood, ma'am."

I hold out until my cabin door clicks shut behind me. Slowly I sink to the floor, back pressed against the door, fingers fumbling for a pouch of cigarettes that isn't there. I'm shivering at first, then shaking, and then my chest is spasming and I'm doubled up, my whole body quivering from the force of my silent sobs.

I let her out again. I fucking *let her out.*

By the time I manage to unclench my fist there's red marks in my calluses and blood caked under my nails.

The last time I had to do that was the day I got Sparrow her White Stripe. And I was angry then, full of adrenaline and righteous fire, and not so far off from the old days. And I had time to psych myself up first. It still hurt, obviously it still hurt, throwing that bloodsoaked old raiment upon my soul again after how deep I fought to bury it, but that time it was like a flesh wound. Barely a papercut to the inner Spark.

This time it was a knife in the gut.

I think the worst part was how easily it came. Completely automatic. The Commander is always there, waiting in the dark recesses of my spirit for a sign to leap out and take charge of every situation. And for a while it's like the Victory Gala never came.

I am so afraid one day I'll put that armor on and it'll never come off again.

I sit there for a good long while, staring blankly at the handset dock on the table, easily the most unfamiliar thing in the room. Inside it's quiet and clear but for what feels like the distant thumping of artillery fire, threatening to get closer if I think about anything, anything at all, if I so much as *move* and my old wounds flare up again. I feel so *dirty* I could scrub and scrub for hours and I still wouldn't feel clean, dirty *under my skin*. And I don't know how much time actually passes before I finally reach up and wrap my unsteady hand around the receiver to pull it down to my lips.

It's silent for a moment, then I hear a clatter, heavy breathing, and-- "Ambassador? Comrade, is all well?"

I stare at the soft, meaningless green symbols on the handset's light-up panel.

"Ambassador? Comrade Kestrel, please come in--"

"Soshten." I whisper. My throat hurts so bad I can barely get it out without whimpering.

"Er, no, comrade, this is Nishuin, the line goes directly to my--"

"Soshten," I reply softly. "Please. Please just. Get her."

"…Comrade? I don't, er--"

"Please." I can't hold back the whimper that time, and there's obvious alarm in Nishuin's voice when she replies.

"I-- yes, of course, at once, Ambassador. Er, that would be Comrade Soshten Mirvasi, yes?"

"Y-yeah."

"I will relay your summons. Is there anything else--"

The receiver slips from my fingers and clatters to the ground. I slump back against the door, burying my head in my knees and wrapping my arms tight around the back of my head and neck.

The next thing I register is soft hands on my body. Footsteps, voices, light. For once, I don't lash out. I'm not sure I could make myself. I feel like I did that morning in the barracks when I was still a nameless grunt, the day before we shipped out to Shattercrest -- except, I suppose, with none of the residual afterglow.

I blink, again and again until the tears have cleared enough that I can see. 

Soshten is sitting above me. She's in her… underwear, I guess, a soft, tight black wrap around her breasts, and another around her thighs. The sight is enough to immediately recenter my attention. I'm splayed out on my bed, I realize. Soshi is hunched beside me, one arm tight around her legs, softly stroking my abs with her free hand. As my eyes begin to focus she starts, leaning closer.

"Kess?" she murmurs. She's trying to hide the fear in her voice but it keeps cracking and wobbling, and the redness of her eyes says plain that she's been crying.

God within I am such a selfish dick.

"I… I gave you a dose of your medication." She gropes for her handset. "Shalvan's holding for you if… if there's anything… I haven't told anyone else, I haven't told Nishuin -- should I get Bear or--?"

I curl up closer to her, my head pressed tight against her thigh. She stops, and wraps her arms around me tightly, softly stroking my back. Her soft, perfect skin against mine, her lips on my forehead, the gentle rhythm of her pets are enough that my breathing starts to calm.

"Kess? Please just. Please just say something. Kess, I'm scared--"

"I'm sorry," I whisper, throat raw, voice husky and cracked. I feel like I've been crying a lot harder than I remember.

"What happened? Stars and skies, who did this to you--"

I shake my head. "She did. *I* did."


"You know, I heard the most *interesting* rumor this afternoon." A smirk is tugging at Soshten's lips.

"Do tell?"

"I heard that a certain foreign dignitary has been flirting with our handsome young officers."

"Iiiii would not know anything about that," I reply, my gaze slipping away as my cheeks start burning.



Soshten grins. "These suits are crammed with sensors and effectors, and we've had this tech for centuries now. People have written all kinds of software for them."

My cheeks are burning and I'm stammering as I start to realize the implications. Only then do I realize. "You're… telling me you managed to fit a *computer* in here?" I stare at her, poking at the thin fabric, and giving myself an unintentional jolt to the arm. "No. No way. I do not believe you. That's not even possible--"

Soshten just laughs at me. "There's a ton of redundant networked processors spread throughout the suit so getting shot in the wrong place doesn't take the whole thing offline. We can make compute cores smaller than that, Kess. And that's not even getting into what the Echoes -- agh, sorry, I mean the Thalisans -- can do. I've heard their processors can't even be seen with the naked eye."

"No *way*. I know better than to believe the stories people make up about the Shadows. You're just messing with me."

"Am not. *Think,* Kess, how could we pack all that functionality into those suits without onboard processors?" There's an evil gleam in her eye now. "If you don't believe me I can prove it to you. Let me just go get a laptop and I'll write a new program for it here and now--"

I shrink back towards the pillow. "Okay, okay, I believe you, you don't have to threaten me!"

"Aren't you just a *little* bit curious what I have in store for you?"

"How do I take away your access again?"

She just grins and strokes my inner thigh, making me yelp at the sudden, tingling galvanic current. "Gosh, I'm getting all kinds of evil ideas now. I could just leave this program on and you'd never figure out how to turn it off--"

Immediately I touch my back and make the "unseal" gesture with my right hand. Thank God, it works perfectly this time, and the small indentation down the back splits neatly in two. Soshten pouts as I pull the suit off; I roll it up and throw it at her.

"Spoilsport." I blink. She's very suddenly holding the suit neatly folded. I didn't even see her move, not even a blur. She sets it on the corner of the bed, hooking up the power leads.

"Like I'm going to give you a chance to lock that thing on me," I return.

"Ooh, now there's an idea." She straddles me, pushing me down flat on the bed and kissing me tenderly on the lips. "Maybe next time~"

*"Agh."* I squirm as she presses a knee forcefully up between my thighs.

"For the record," she murmurs, taking my wrists in her hands and pinning me down, staring unblinking into my eyes, "there is *nothing* you can actually stop me from doing to you." She giggles at the expression on my face. "If I wanted to force that thing back on you right now, *believe you me* I could do it." For a moment it's like tight iron manacles a size too small are squeezing my wrists and her eyes are burning into mine, but then she releases me. "Stars and skies you're so cute when you're scared," she observes, laying on her side and idly massaging my breast with her right hand.

I sigh, trying to make myself relax. "You were just bullshitting me, weren't you."

"What? No, no, not at all. I really could. Want me to show you?"

*"No* thank you," I lie.

"Tch. You're so tense. I'm sorry, I'll stop teasing you, I can tell I'm just making it worse." She pats me on the shoulder. "C'mon, turn over. I'll rub your back 'til it's better."

I sigh. "I haven't been able to properly relax without a good strong bottle of gin in years."

"Challenge accepted. Turn over or I'll *make* you."

"Okay, okay." I flop over and she straddles me again, kissing me softly on the back of the neck.

"You know," she comments playfully, "there's a suit program for this--"

*"No."*

"The constrictors and galvanic effectors are actually *really good* for massage. Best part is you can just leave it on as long as you want."

"Soshi."

"Imagine getting a nice, full-body massage all the way through some long, boring meeting. Wouldn't that be nice? A few hours of that and all that stress and strain will just float away, I'll bet you."

I feel my cheeks starting to heat up again. "I-- I think that would be *really* embarassing."

"What? Why? I don't think anyone would notice--"

"They would notice when I started *blushing and gasping and moaning,* Soshi."

"But that's part of the fun, keeping your reactions under control." She takes me by the shoulders, squeezing and rubbing expertly, and I sigh quietly. The physical pleasure of her forceful touch feels even better than the fake _sèing_ they gave me. Something to keep in mind if I start craving the evil stuff.

"Uh, I don't think I physically *could.*"

She snickers. "What kind of training were they even giving you? If you couldn't keep such a basic level of discipline--"

"Basic level--" I laugh unsteadily. "Where I come from, 'discipline' means 'obeying orders and not mouthing off at your superiors too often'. I don't think I saw anyone so much as stand to attention for the first year of our fight."

"If you can't even control your reaction to pleasurable stimulus, how are you ever going to cope with pain? One little cry at the wrong moment can give away your position. Someone who can't control their reactions is *dangerous* if you don't want a nice little airstrike right on top of your sniper's nest."

"So, what, Society basic trains you to keep quiet in bed?"

I can't see her face but her voice is deadly serious. "Self-control is important, Kess. *Especially* for us. Men have it easy, their bodies don't fight them every step of the way when they try to be all stoic. Y'know, there's actually a party game we play sometimes where you just work someone over to try and get a noise out of them, see how long they can hold out. It's really fun, it's *so* satisfying to take some cute girl who thinks she's tough and just *break* her, take away all of her self-control bit by bit. *Especially* when the rest of her unit is watching. Good practice, too." She presses her thumbs *hard* into my shoulder muscles and I gasp heavily, trying to pull away from the intolerable sensation. She doesn't relent until I'm a writhing mess, giggling uncontrollably and begging her to stop. "You wouldn't last two seconds," she observes as she finally lets up.

"Are all your games th-that cruel?" Panting, I clutch a pillow like it'll somehow protect me.

"Only the fun ones. I managed to last two whole *minutes* with my CO a couple years ago, and he's *brutal*." She shivers, letting out a happy sigh. "I don't think anyone else in my unit came close."

"Con... gratulations?"

"Thanks!"

I gaze out the window. My back twinges as I reorient myself, and a thought occurs.

"Hey, Soshi?"

"Yeah, hon?"

*'Hon' already?* "The suit restrictors… they can operate in reverse, right?"

"Yeah, we use those to help cope with higher-grav worlds when there isn't time to adapt our bodies. Guess for baselines it'd be pretty good for combat too. Why do you ask?"

I lean back, nestling into the pillows. "One of my last ops before the end of the war… fuck, it was stupid. There was a noble we were sent to grab, as a hostage to get her family to surrender. It was like taking *bai due* from a *pien şai,* I don't even know why they wasted the Ninth on that op; blackops trainees could have done it without supervision and it would have gone off without a hitch." I sigh. *"Almost* without a hitch. Security was armed with frag grenades, and when they forced us out of cover -- I swear, I didn't even feel anything until the op was done, but apparently some shrapnel sliced right through my armor when I was diving. Thank God it just grazed me, but--" I tap my lower back "--it was close enough to tear right through a muscle and some nerves."

"Oh! That's awful. I'm so sorry."

"I guess the damage was just too extensive for my body to heal. Even after years of physical therapy it's hard to sit up. Hurts like hell too and no matter how much I exercise it doesn't get any easier, after a point."

"Why haven't you gotten it fixed--" Soshten stops, slightly dropping her head. "Don't tell me. You don't have the medical tech."

"I... didn't know there was medical tech *could* fix an injury like that," I murmur.

"Of course there is. Kess, we can replace whole *bodies* from a stem cell culture if we have to; of course we can repair a little muscle damage. We'll get that fixed up for you on Tel Casran." She pauses, clasps her hands awkwardly. "If you... trust us to work on you,that is."

"You..." I whisper, stunned. "You would... you'd seriously?"

She glares at me. "Kestrel Winterblossom what part of *comrades* do you not understand? Of course we'll help our allies. We do this all the time."

"How much would it--" I begin, but catch myself. "--ignore that, please."

She laughs out loud. "Were you seriously about to ask how much it would cost?"

"Old habits die *real* hard, Soshi."

"All you have to do is ask, sweetheart. There might be a bit of a wait -- some of the more specialized procedures can only be done on Tel Casran, especially the ones for *uasdannen,* and it's first-come, first serve unless triage says otherwise -- but it's not gonna *cost* you anything."

"That's... wow." I take a deep breath. "I thought... I thought I'd be living with this for the rest of my life."

"Nope! Also, good thought on the suit. It should definitely be able to compensate for your muscle weakness."

"Can you…?"

"I can try. Really this is something you need a medic to do, but since you don't need to be combat-ready I can hack together a little patch to tide you over for the moment." She gives me a flirty little smile. "We can go to the medic together when I'm off duty this evening."

"God, please. Thank you so much. That sounds amazing."


"Anything else you want me to set up for you?" She idly taps a key and I can't help but yelp at the sudden pressure against my clitoris. "Say, a bit of… sporadic encouragement?"

"You *turn that off* or I swear by God within I will *find* some way to hurt you." I squeeze my thighs together but it does nothing to affect the pulses of pressure. I bury my burning cheeks in a pillow.

She giggles. "You're *fun,* Kess." I let out a quiet gasp as the pressure momentarily intensifies, but then slackens off. "I guess I'll have mercy on you... *this time*."

*New mission, top priority: get Nalshan to invalidate her login for me -- civilian casualties acceptable.*

*"Thank you,"* I mutter. I squeeze the pillow between my thighs, breathing deeply, and look back up. "And no, I think you're up in my personal space enough already. You wanna touch me inappropriately, use your damn hands to do it."

Soshten snickers. "Alright, alright. Stand for me; I gotta get some recordings."

Reluctantly, I turn and lower my feet to the floor. "This better not be a trick to get me to show off my ass."

"Kess, you wound me! As if I would neglect your beautiful tits." She beckons. "C'mon. I swear on my honor I'm not messing with you."

"You just called my tits 'beautiful,' you are obviously messing with me."

"What? What makes you say that?" She sounds genuinely puzzled.

"Soshi. My chest is *tiny.* I could actually fight without my chestguard in a pinch; even sprinting and rolling for cover only hurt a little."

Again, *the look.* "What does size have to do with anything? You're really well proportioned, you have a great silhouette, and they bounce just enough to be sexy without going all over the place and making you look silly." She swats my breast lightly. "If anything, bigger tits would ruin your look. You're pretty average-sized, anyway."

"Average?" I poke her chest in retaliation. "I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but we are *both* so small it's hard to find protective wear in our sizes."

"Okay, average by *my* standards. Many Zyahua women look odd to me. I thought it was some kind of cosmetic surgery fad at first."

"That's average for you?" I pat her on the head. "Is that because you're so tiny?"

She takes my hand, holds it to her breast, makes me squeeze gently. I blush softly, her breast warm and firm beneath the thin fabric of her *rancal;* her heartbeat pulses in my fingers. "This is a comfort- and combat-optimized breast, carefully selected for over hundreds of years," she says, sounding almost *proud.* "We only need chest protection for the most strenuous activities. I could suckle a baby while dodging gunshots and I'd be perfectly comfortable. Not that I would ever do such an insane thing," she adds quickly.

"…that is so weird."

"It was just an example."

"No, I mean…" I shake my head. "You talk about *yourself* the way engineers talk about their machines."

"Well, we *are* engineered. These bodies are our own design, made for living life to the fullest. "

"And killing life to the fullest."

"Also that!" She doesn't even seem to notice the barb, just grinning that infectious grin of hers. "We are in all ways markedly superior to the People of five generations ago, and the People five generations to come will, if fate allows, be even further superior to us."

"Doesn't that... bother you?"

"Bother me?" She laughs. "It excites me! After all we've accomplished in a thousand years, I cannot even imagine what we will be like in another thousand. All I know is that every generation will be better off than the last, and that's wonderful. Wouldn't you want your children to have better lives than you did?"

"Yes," I blurt. *"Obviously."*

"There you go then. We reach eternally toward perfection, and it is glorious to behold." She pats my rear. "Just like your ass. Now c'mon. I need recordings."

"What do you need me to do?"

"Basically? Do whatever hurts the most."

I wince. "Great."

"No pain, no gain, babe." She winks at me.

I move through a few different poses, straining my back muscles as much as I dare. Normally I'm cautious with them, relying on my arms and my surroundings for leverage to lessen the blow, but that's not an option now, and it's agonizing, especially performing all these moves after another. "This was a bad idea," I mutter as I collapse to my cot.

"Why's that?"

"I have *things* to do to today. *Walking around* things. I'm going to ache for hours at this rate."

"Your *shanvol* meds are an exorphine blend, hon. Just take a dose, it'll knock the pain out." She cracks her knuckles, and starts tapping away on the keyboard. "Can you lay down flat, then sit up slowly? I need a clean nerve recording."

"Ugh, fine. What do you mean, a nerve recording?"

"The way the restrictors work is they use the electro-mesh to monitor impulses in your skin. That way they can work in real time, instead of having to forecast from the propriosensors. Basically, it links up right into your body the way a limb would."

"…wow. Can you, like… make machines that work like a limb? Like, your soul-- or, um, your brain, I guess -- just pushes it around direct instead of going through a control panel?"

"Yes! It's tricky though. You need this band on your head just above your ears to pick up the brainwaves, and then you have to train with the machine for a while to get it synced to your unique soul. If you want full sensory integration that's gonna take surgery, maybe brain surgery, and that's only really worth it for prosthetics. Our ID implants have some basic feedback functionality built in these days, though." She taps the back of her neck.

"Damn. That's… impressive."

"Thanks!"

"Have you ever used anything like that?"

"Yeah! I did the sync training with my hardsuit. It's pretty new tech and kind of experimental, so most people are still using the on-glove contacts for armor control. But thought-control is so intense, I can just operate on instinct and I'm probably a lot more effective than someone using the old-style interface. I bet I could take on ten *vitiular* like that and rip them apart. Man, what an edge that would have been in the War!"

"'Vits… _vitiular_'?"

"Your pronunciation is getting better already! Sorry, that's our name for -- I think you called them the _den tsuang vó_. Imperial Guard."

"You're kidding me. Ten of those bitches, at once?"

"I mean, I won't know for sure until I've tried. But I bet I could."

I look down. "I would give a *lot* to watch that," I mutter bitterly. She laughs.

"Don't tempt fate, babe."

"Yeah. Right. I should know better than that."

She strikes a contact on the laptop with a triumphant flourish. "Try now. The new patch should be active."

Hesitantly, I sit up, instinctively expecting my back to flare up again. It's still hurting from earlier, but to my astonishment, I find myself sitting up with almost no effort at all. It's like when you gently push a door shut and you've forgotten you left a window open, and the thing just slams so hard you jump. Experimentally I stand, bending this way and that, trying to adjust to the new ease of movement.

"Soshi," I whisper, staring at her.

"How's it work? Is it--"

I reach up with a quivering hand to wipe away the tears trickling from my eye. "Thank you. Thank you, thank you, *thank you--"*

"So, it's working then?"

"Soshi, this is amazing. I feel… oh, my God. I haven't felt this whole in so long." My gaze drops to my feet, my cheeks hot. "I think I could dance again," I whisper.

Soshten claps her hands in triumph. _"Sav valari cite!_ Wow, Kess, you look-- I don't think you looked this happy even after I was through with you last night, and you were *so* pent up--"

The tears are streaming uncontrollably now and I give up on wiping my eyes. Experimentally I trace out a few steps of an old folk dance Sparrow taught me all those years ago. I feel so *light."*

I turn and tug Soshten to her feet. She clasps her hands demurely behind her back, gazing up at me flirtatiously, and I pull her close, hugging her so tightly I might actually have hurt her if she was a baseline. "Thank you," I whisper again, and she laughs happily, stroking my back.

"Don't get too excited," she tells me. "This is really something that should be done by a medic, so don't go crazy until he's had a chance to clean up my mess, okay?"

"Okay."

I had expected to feel something pushing against me like a helping hand when I worked the damaged muscles, but it really feels completely seamless. I could easily forget that the suit was helping me at all.

We *need* this tech.

She kisses me again. "I really gotta get to work, babe," she murmurs, squeezing me tight. I rub the back of her neck, wrap an arm around her waist.

"Okay," I whisper again, resting my forehead against hers.

"I'll come by when I'm off duty and take you to the medic, alright?"

"Alright."

She steps back, holding me by the shoulders, backing onto the step by the doorway so our eyes are level. "I think I love you, Kess," she says. And before I can recover enough presence of mind to respond, she's gone, the door closing softly behind her.

I'm still blushing stupidly when I arrive at Nalshan's little conference room. He looks up, surprised, when I enter.

"Ambassador. Welcome; I wasn't expecting you yet."

"Shouldn't you be calling me 'cadet'?" I tease him.

"Indeed," he says, glancing at the inscrutable clock, "in about two minutes or so."

"I was hoping you could help me with a problem, so I came early."

"I'm happy to help. Suit giving you trouble?"

I purse my lips. "If, um. I let someone else authorize themselves so they can program my suit -- how do I revoke that authorization again?"

Nalshan looks up from his slate, an amused look on his features. "You did *what?* I never showed you how to do that."

"She kind of let herself in."

"What in Haven possessed you to allow such a thing?"

I squeeze my wrist awkwardly. "She... talked me into it. In retrospect I don't know what I was thinking."

"Hmm." Nalshan folds his arms. "I'm very sorry, Ambassador, but I do not think I can assist you in this matter."

"Wh-what? Why not?"

"Firstly, your decision was a grievous security lapse. Ordinarily that would be cause for corporal punishment, but I think in this case a more suitable punishment would be for you to live with the consequences of your decision." He raises a hand as I start to open my mouth. "Careful, comrade. You have approximately 20 seconds until you're mouthing off to a superior officer. Now, *additionally,* the level of power over your body you've given away, I think that's actually an excellent trust-building exercise that will in time help you open up to Comrade Soshten and let your guard down around her."

I narrow my eyes. *"I never said her name."*

"…really?" Nalshan falters. "That's so strange, I could have sworn you said--"

"I said *nothing of the kind.*" I fold my arms, glaring at the instructor. "Are you *conspiring* behind my back?"

Nalshan holds up a finger, pointing at the clock. "'Are you conspiring behind my back, *sir*'."

"…sir," I murmur, reddening. He smirks.

"That will be all, cadet. If you would take your seat."


The medic scans through the complicated flow chart, expanding and collapsing various boxes and emitting the occasional word that sounds like it's probably a curse, especially judging from how Soshten looks a little bit more humiliated each time.

"I think," he says finally, turning back to me, "I will have to excise this entire patch and program a new one around the physio-neuro profile data."

Soshten cringes. "It was that bad?"

"We have standard techniques and templates for this form of treatment which are designed to work seamlessly across a wide variety of combat, utility, and therapeutic smartwear, and they have been tested, deployed, and refined over *hundreds of years*, comrade," says the medic, folding his arms. "There is no point in trying to salvage this… arcane contraption of clumsily reinvented wheels glued together with neutron-degenerate conditionals and *desperate prayers to uncaring dark gods."*

"Wow. Um. I'm sorry?"

He waves her away. "It is alright. I'm… reasonably certain your logic patch couldn't have actually hurt her. If only because of the suit's built-in safeties, which *someone* thoughtfully adjusted for baseline strength and durability beforehand. I *wonder* who that could have been. But next time, *ask a professional first.*"

"Yessir. I will do that." Soshten looks deflated. I pat her on the shoulder.

"I thought it worked great," I tell her. She gives me a rueful smile.

"Up until the point you tried to dance, swim, practice Kapa flex-meditation, or train in *sovran,*" mutters the medic, wiping several large logic trees with a few savage flicks of his wrist. He spends a few moments doing incomprehensibly abstract things to the computer screen, and then turns to me. "I've replaced the patch, Kestrel-ambassador. Your movements should hopefully feel more natural now?"

I hesitantly bend my waist this way and that. "I think so, yeah," I murmur.

"You will be pleased to know that when your suit is adjusted for gravitomimesis, it will *not* cause horrible and potentially painful glitches in the new code."

"That… is good to hear, thank you."


"He was an ass," I say as the door closes behind us. Soshten shakes her head.

"He was absolutely right to dress me down. I overstepped my bounds."

"Maybe, but he didn't have to be so hurtful about it. You were just trying to help."

"He was actually very forgiving and lenient with me. In his position I would have been a lot harsher."

"I— *what?"*

"Sharp words leave lasting wounds. I will hopefully not be able to make such a mistake again without remembering how small and stupid I felt in there just now."

"That's… cold."

"The universe is a cold place, Kess. If we are to fill it with warmth, we must never mistake the source of that warmth for anything but our own hearts. Nature won't play by our rules no matter how proud we grow."

"Dammit, Soshi, I'm trying to comfort you here."

"You should not. I got what I deserved. You are very kind and thoughtful, but I am alright, Kess. You don't need to worry."

"If… if you say so," I murmur, taking her hand and squeezing.


"Oh, and Kess?"

"Yeah?"

"If you were serious about submitting to military discipline, you should *really* put your voidskin back on. Nalshan isn't going to go easy on you just because you're a foreigner."

"How will he even know--"

"Because the suits record vitals and he will definitely notice the suspicious lack of a heartbeat for eight hours."

"I seriously have to sleep in this thing?"

"You're going to have to anyway shipboard, that's like half the reason these things exist. You'll be risking cancer or suffocation otherwise. It's not a small risk either. We had to fend off raiders twice on my last flight out. You might as well get used to it now." The playful edge to her voice is gone; she sounds deadly serious now, almost worried. "Besides, those vital recordings are actually really important, especially since you're *uasdani* and we can't really make presumptions about your physiology. Once the suit has a profile for you, it can send automatic alarms if, you know, your blood pressure spikes, your heart rate gets too high, you have a panic attack, anything like that. That's important data for our medics to have if you get sick on Tel Casran some day, and it's *really* important your first tour on a spacecraft. You're going into an extreme environment you've never been in before and if you have some kind of reaction -- Kess, I just want you to be safe."

I purse my lips. "Can it… if I'm having another "

"…promise me you'll stop fucking around with the programming?"

"Absolutely not," she replies smugly, taking my chin in her hands. Her emerald eyes almost seem luminous in the darkness. "I'm going to take advantage of you every chance I get," she whispers, her lips almost touching mine, "and when I'm through with you? You're gonna *beg* me for more."


"I had a thought last night." She keeps tapping away on the keyboard. "Your voidskin should be able to detect if you have another *shanvol* attack, right? Obviously the first thing to do is summon help, but I think also…" She narrows her eyes, taps a key a few times. "Ah, here it is. So, I can set it up so the suit effectors react on their own. Do you think that would help you cool down, or maybe keep you lucid long enough to dose yourself? Like, if an automatic massage protocol kicked in -- I could key the specifics, like if there's a particular way you like being touched that might help bring you back --"

"If you do that I'm just going to start associating that kind of touch with my attacks."

"Right. Yeah, sorry, you're right, that was stupid of me." She rubs her forehead distractedly. "So, randomize it, then." She punches a key and part of the complicated flow chart on her screen folds up and vanishes. "Do you think it would help, though? We can "

"Can you make it automatically give me a dose of that… that fentadone stuff?"

She winces. "Not without a medic's help, and believe you me it would hurt. When I… when my ship was attacked, my suit scrubbers were the only thing that kept me alive long enough for my CO to get me into my armor. So I know what it feels like when the venous feeds deploy and while I'm *very glad they did* I hope never to experience that particular sensation again."

I shrug. "How could that be worse than a… a *shanvol* episode?"

"It's not worse on its own, but it'll make you freak out even worse. The drug doesn't take effect instantly."

I think for a moment. "Nalshan said the suit has… resistors, to simulate gravity? For our muscles?"

"Yup."

"How strong can those get?"

"Pretty strong, they're designed for *randani* muscles after all."

I'm quiet for a moment. I really don't want to give the devious little sadist ideas, but... "Could they work as a restraint? Just, resist all movement completely?"

"Yes they could, and we actually use that feature a lot. Helps with transporting patients, keeping muscle spasms under control, disciplining naughty cadets..."

Of course she had to go there. I roll my eyes. "Could you make it so if it detects… like if I'm panicking again, could you make the suit restrain me? So I don't, y'know. Hurt anyone."

She stops typing and turns to face me, pushing the laptop away. "I'm not gonna do that, Kess," she says somberly.

"What!?" I blurt. "If you can, then why not? That way--"

"Kess." She reaches out and takes my hand. "There's a million reasons that's a terrible idea -- first off being you wouldn't even be able to dose yourself -- and you don't even have a good reason to want me to do this."

"Not wanting to hurt people is a bad idea?"

"You cannot possibly hurt me or anyone else in this embassy. Even if you pulled a *gun* on me point *blank* I could easily disarm you long before you pulled the trigger, and you don't *have* a gun."

"What if I panicked again and grabbed yours--"

She laughs aloud, pulls her pistol out of her holster, and tosses it to me; I catch it reflexively, my eyes widening at the number of safety regs she must have casually broken just now. "Go ahead. Try and shoot me." She spreads her arms wide. "I won't even dodge."

"What!?" I stare at her in shock. Gingerly I put the gun down on the table, pushing it away from me. "I will *not,* why would you--"

"Then point it at the window or something." She pushes the gun back into my hands, makes me close my fist around it. "Seriously, pull the trigger. I want to show you you have nothing to worry about."

"Is this some kind of fucked-up test--"

She sighs, and forces my finger down onto the trigger. The gun lets out a reproachful chirp, but nothing else happens.

"Only we can use our weapons. Anyone else tries, the safety won't unlock, end of story." Gently she pries the gun from my frozen hands, and slots it back into her holster. "You have nothing to worry about. Look, Kess, I spent years in therapy, I know perfectly well what's going on here. This isn't about protecting anyone, you just still feel guilty because you tried to hit me the other morning."

"I tried to *kill* you!"

"That's adorable. Look, I've said it again and again -- you have your instincts for a reason. You probably wouldn't have survived without them and I am very glad you survived. You weren't in control that morning, you didn't do any damage, and you physically could not have done. You're trying to punish yourself over irrational guilt. Just let it go."

"I don't want to be a threat!"

"You're not. Kess, you are not a threat to me or any of the People. An untrained teenage girl could restrain you without breaking a sweat, and *everyone* that age has some level of UC training. I know you could hurt your own kind, but you're going to be in a place where we can intervene for four years at least. That's four years to sort yourself out. Unless you start sleeping with your own staff you have nothing to be afraid of. Or the other diplomats, I guess."

"I think that would be a national security nightmare."

"Hey, I don't judge." She slaps me on the rear. "Listen. I'm shit at this. Talk to Shalvan. "


"Mm." Shalvan nods slowly. "I agree with Comrade Soshten. "


"Regarding Comrade Soshten -- have you begun an intimate relationship with her?"

My cheeks immediately start burning. "What," I babble. "Y-wh-- you-- that is *none of your business--*"

Shalvan looks mortified, and claps a hand to his chest. "Forgive me! I did not realize this was a taboo topic."

"It's a *really fucking personal topic* is what it is," I blurt. "You can't possibly tell me that's a normal thing for you to discuss with your clients!"

"With my *patients,*" Shalvan softly corrects me. "And it is a perfectly normal topic to discuss. Among the People, that is. Such relationships are complex, and helping our citizens navigate intimacy with one another is one of the most important functions of a *virtash.*"

"Help navigate--? Do you think I need *help* finding her clitoris or something?"

"I mean *socially*, comrade." Shalvan holds up his hands. "Please, peace. I meant no offense, and from the bottom of my heart I apologize for so grievously offending you. I will not broach the topic again."

I breathe deeply for a moment. "You said… you work with the other Greens here."

"I do, yes."

"Does Soshten see you too?"

"She does."

"So are you telling me she's going to… to tell you all about--"

"If there are matters you do not wish her disclose to me in our meetings -- or to anyone -- you may wish to advise her of this. Soshten is a kind and truly honorable woman, but she is only somewhat more familiar with your culture than I am. Clear, effective, and respectful communication is the keystone of all relationships; to such dramatically cross-cultural ones, trebly so."

I gaze at him. "You're really… okay with the fact that I'm sleeping with one of your security personnel? I thought… I thought this would be a huge deal."

He blinks. "Why?"

"Why!? Well, I-- she-- I mean, I'm an ambassador to a foreign power-- you guys take security *really seriously*--"

"Soshten is a mature woman who has a deep love for her comrades and her nation. There is no need to infantilize her. You can trust her not to use her position to exploit you for political leverage over your nation, and we can trust her not to let *you* use her in turn."

"I would *never*--"

"Nor would she. Beyond that, why should there be any reason for her superiors to interfere with your dalliance?"

I gaze at him quietly for a moment. "You people are… really accepting," I say slowly. He laughs heartily; it's an infectious laugh, one that sets me somewhat more at ease, and I can't help but smile weakly even though I don't know what the joke is.

"Accepting! No, no, not in the slightest, no. Of the galactic civilizations, we are *without question* the strictest, and we require absolute self-discipline, obedience, and loyalty from our comrades. We have no margin of tolerance whatsoever for antisocial or degenerate conduct, and exact severe punishments for a wide range of behaviors your Republic and the Empire alike would hardly notice. What you perceive is not *acceptance*, Comrade Ambassador, but compatibility. Or did you think emotional intimacy between *uastashar* and the People was a commonplace occurrence?"

"I… didn't realize it was that special, no."

"It is. Virtually all of us expect a form and depth of connection that is rarely found outside homespace. For Comrade Soshten to take you for her own suggests she sees in you a kindred spirit. She is of a race cut off from your own and sculpted over a thousand years towards a harshly defined ideal of human perfection; she is a woman who has her entire life been relentlessly shaped into a loving comrade, a capable warrior, and a thoughtful, responsible citizen. Between what she is -- what we all are -- and what the Zyahua, the Khmai, even the Kaparttu are, there lies a gulf so vast it is bridged only with great difficulty. Even the people of the League, for the most part, are but a single step closer to our nature than the people of the Empire or the Union."

"For the most part?" I tilt my head slightly, realizing moments later that I'm already imitating their facial mannerisms. Shalvan definitely notices.

"Well, we have a pet name for the UA Diamond -- the _Ranuen_, the 'little Society,' you might very roughly translate it. Its people are most unusual, perhaps unique; there exists a degree of mutual admiration between our cultures, and theirs, though quite distinct, was modeled directly after our own. All the same, my point stands -- you are no Diamondite; indeed, from what you have told me I suspect their way of life would be intolerable to you. By bonding with one of the People, you have achieved something remarkable. Whether by accident, will, or the design of fate you have accomplished a closeness of soul to our own without any of the advantages we had in doing so. Yours is a baseline psyche, with your native sociopathic and self-serving traits fully intact, and without any of the early childhood training normally necessary to self-moderate. And yet you do so. To us, this is far more impressive than simply growing into a good citizen and comrade from within our system."

"That's the first time anyone's tried to *compliment* me by calling me a *sociopath*," I say slowly, unsure of how to react.

"No, no, please, you misunderstand -- oh, comrade, I do *so* apologize, again I offend in my ignorance --" he sounds genuinely anguished "-- I did not mean to suggest that you were an exemplar of those unsavory traits, merely that they exist untempered within your race."

I stare at him, my expresion held carefully neutral. "As... opposed to?"

"Our bodies are not the only thing we elected to modify in the execution of our eugenic program. Our spectrum of neurological expression has been slightly but substantively pruned, you might say, in order to depress or eliminate altogether certain traits deemed inimical either to individuals or to the Society at large."

"You… you *rewired your own souls!?*" I take a deep breath. *You're a damn diplomat. Be diplomatic. Don't be an asshole no matter how much he sounds like Silverdawn right now.* "I… I'm sorry, this is a-a-a--a lot to process." My voice sounds slightly manic, even to me.

He tilts his head. "In what ways? Can I be of assistance?"

"Well… one, um, be *very very* careful who you tell this to? Obviously the Old Faith isn't entirely *popular* around here anymore, but there's still parts of it-- like, most of us still believe in God and Her Plan and we still believe that our souls are sparks of Her divinity. What you just *casually told me* is the *worst imaginable* kind of blasphemy. From the point of view of the faith, I mean. It throws the whole Plan into question."

"But we did not change our *souls.* That is likely beyond any power north of the Counterspin; perhaps beyond even the Echoes. Only our genetics, our physical brains--"

"You changed your personalities."

"We changed the way personalities develop within our race, yes."

"To any Zyahua that means you did *something* to your souls. We have enough reason to be afraid of you and how *alien* you are without being told that you *defiled shards of God* and maybe *ruined* the *entire purpose of Creation.*"

"…e-even though it has produced generations of increasingly compassionate and empathetic citizens? The societal benefits--"

"It doesn't *matter.* You're completely missing the point."

"Please forgive my ignorance! I have no background in comparative theology whatsoever."

I laugh weakly. "Well, me neither. I just know how I was brought up. And I know most of us would think that tampering with divinity is a whole higher order of wrong, sin on a cosmic scale. A lot of Zyahua would see you as abominations if they knew. I don't know about the other races, but I do know you'd be feeding a powerful gift into the mouths of Imperial propagandists."

Shalvan looks down, clasping his hands. "I… I see," he murmurs, sounding actually a little *upset.* "Well, I... appreciate the forewarning, Ambassador. I will caution my superiors to restrict this information -- if I have your permission to do so?"

"Yes, of course. There a form I need to sign?"

"When we've finished for the day, yes." Shalvan sets aside his slate. "Ambassador, I would like to ask -- you have been speaking in terms of the reactions of others, but your own discomfort is apparent. How do *you* feel about what I have just revealed? Do *you* see us as abominations?"

"Wh-what? No!" I blurt, raising my hands. "Not at all, I -- I *like* you." My cheeks are suddenly hot, and I can't help but look away. "I don't know, it's been… difficult but… being here has been rewarding. It really has. Even just a couple days of getting to know some Greens. This place… I don't know *what* exactly it makes me feel because I've never felt it before but… it's not a bad thing." I lower my voice again. "Not at all."

"It is gratifying to hear that you think well of the People." Shalvan smiles, a note of relief in his voice. "What about your own faith? Can you reconcile it with this?"

I let out another fragile bark of laughter, massaging my forehead. "Oh, God. I haven't thought about questions like that in… in a really long time. I guess when you've seen what I've seen you stop thinking about the universe as if there's some sort of grand plan for all of Heaven. Priestesses just start to sound so hollow after a while, like some idiot civvie spilling platitudes after your best friend's just been blown to bits right in front of you. I don't really see any meaning out there, anymore. Just the meaning we make for it all ourselves."

He gives me a mischievous smile. "I believe I understand. Our own spiritual teachings are not entirely dissimilar."


Shalvan's eyes widen, and in a soft, low voice he asks gently, "Kestrel, are you saying -- in addition to everything else you've told me about -- you were *raped in the line of duty* as well?"

I shrug. "You don't got to be so dramatic about it. I… I don't even know what to call it. Like I guess it was rape more or less but… Shalvan, I've *seen* what came of girls we took back from the Guard. Civvies we rescued from bandits and other _dua yau wè_ lumpenprole opportunists. When I say that word 'rape' about what happened to me I feel like I'm making light of all that."

"Why so? Do you feel like your suffering was less real in some way, less genuine? --And please, you may call me Shal."

"I don't really think 'suffering' is even the right word, I just." I shrug again. "Shal-- we were at *war*. We were spending day after day bleeding and making other people bleed and watching enemies and friends and total innocents alike die in ways some of them so terrible I can't even think about it without-- without--"

He takes my hand and squeezes, gently prying my nails out of my arm. "Shh. Stop. It's alright. I understand. You're safe. Nobody can hurt you here. Nobody is going to be hurt."

I inhale slowly. "Thank you. It's okay. I'm okay. Look, my point is-- yeah, so the guys had their fun sometimes. *So what*. It's hard for me to begrudge them, knowing firsthand what they always got up and did next. For me, for their comrades, for us all."

"Are you telling me *they weren't even punished?*" Shalvan looks horrified. "They were left in the same unit to continue traumatizing their victims?"

I sigh. "We were still enforcing a lot of the customary law back then. If I had reported them they would have been burned alive. Shal, they didn't deserve that. Those boys-- they were my comrades in arms. They were part of my unit. I don't know if you understand this but to us that's something more than friends. I didn't let the *den tsuang* gun them down on the battlefield and I sure as *ash* wasn't gonna throw them to the flames myself neither. I'm still clinging to those last shreds of my honor."

"So you're saying, your rapist-- rapists? There were more than one?"

"There were a couple."

"Kestrel, *how many times did this happen to you?"*

"A lot, in the early days. Before I was a CO myself. After that-- well, you don't break ranks like that. Not unless she asks for it."

Shalvan squeezes the bridge of his nose distractedly. "So you were raped repeatedly by several different men over the course of your military career, you never reported it-- have you told anyone besides me? Did none of your own comrades even defend you?"

I sigh. "I... I'm not sure you get it, Shal."

"Help me 'get it', then."

"This wasn't some big secret and they weren't bad men. Not really. We all liked each other, we all looked out for each other. Some of them were honest-to-God heroes. One or two are big names today and they *earned* their fame, doing good work they ain't never could have done if I'd thrown them to the pyre out of some kind of… adolescent spite. Some of them saved my ass, my friends' asses, more than once even, and I'm always gonna be grateful for that. I don't resent 'em for doing what they had to do to me stay sane -- I didn't then neither and I sure don't now as all that pain and horror is long behind us. It's something we tell horrible jokes about at parties when old crews get back together, not some dark and hidden shame."

"Saving your life does not entitle a man to your body."

"Doesn't it? I don't know. What I do know is I felt awful ungrateful trying to fight back. They do you a solid, it's only right to give 'em one in turn. And Shal, those early days--" I shudder, groping for the dispenser on my desk just in case. "I saw some real rough and heavy shit towards the end, but that first year or two… maybe it wasn't so qualitatively ugly but there was just so much *more* of that ugly than later on. In the first years we didn't have stable territory. We didn't have a government. We barely had communications and we sure as shit hardly had anything close to military protocol. We were fighting just to survive at that point and the only reason we did was because the Blood hadn't called down the *v--* the Imperial Guard yet."

"So you're saying the early fighting was easier but more… chaotic and intense?"

"We hardly got any rest. In a normal war it's maybe 30% fighting, 70% sitting on your ass waiting for the bullets to start flying. The first two years after shit got serious was maybe 95/5 the other way around. I mean I'm exaggerating but you get my point. Some days you'd stumble to your cot too exhausted to dress down, flop down with your rifle still clenched in your arms, wake up three hours later to your bunkmate shaking you and explosions rattling the windows, and you'd go out and start shooting again before you'd had so much as a cup of _gue lang_ to steady your aim. Common courtesy was you'd make the rounds, make sure all your buddies remembered to eject their clips and clear their barrels before they passed out. If you had enough left in you to stand for that long. Did I mention we sometimes went days without eating?"

Shalvan is staring at me. "Merciful skies," he murmurs.

"When every day is like that -- you wake up to find your bunkmate on top of you and it is sometimes just hard to care. So you don't scream for help, you just lie there and take it, you don't waste your energy on fighting your own squaddies when the enemy's still out there, and then he helps you up and dresses you and you go out and climb into your rickety old excuse for a battle taxi and off you go to perforate some more skulls together. You talk like I should be all upset about it… Shal, I barely even *thought* about it most of the time. I spent so many of those days on full auto. Go here, go there, pull the trigger, return to base, bunk down for so long as Shuharva grants, rinse and repeat. Except it was a good day if we had enough time and water for the 'rinse' part." The dispenser chirps and I set it aside again with an unsteady hand, closing my eyes and silently begging the drug to kick in already. "The sex was part of the blur just like everything else. If anything, a warmer part. Human connection becomes so important in situations like that, big abstracts like 'consent' just stop entering into your head. The way the guys talked about it later on down the road -- you see a girl alone, exhausted, cut up and bruised, the *least* you're gonna do is go over and hug her and hold her while she cries on your shoulder. It would cruel not to, especially when the other men barely have the energy left to *breathe.* Sometimes sex was all I had to offer in return. Fuck, sometimes you just start taking each others' clothes off without either of you really starting it, and you don't even know each others' names, and you go off again without having exchanged a word because in situations like that, talking and thinking turn into priceless materiel you can't waste without a *life-or-death* good reason -- bullets at least get resupplied."

"You make it sound like being taken advantage of was just… routine." Shalvan's voice is a bit weak now. Well, he is a glorified civilian more or less. Come to think of it, how many Greens really could empathize with this? Even Soshten -- even her life-changing trauma was just one little incident with pirates. *Pirates!*

"I was a woman in an army that didn't have so many at the time. You gotta understand, socialism wasn't really a big thing when we started out. Cormorant had her ideas and she had her lieutenants -- folks like me and Silverdawn -- but the actual *people* who signed on, most of the rank and file did it because they had their own grievances with the Blood. Some were proles tired of being worked to death all their lives for shit wages, some were peasants tired of being gouged by raiders and taxwomen. A lot were masculists of one breed or another. We pilfered some of their groups straight up, but there's a lot more men with masculist sympathies who don't actually run off into the wilds to join a band, maybe because raping and smoking themselves silly ain't their idea of a good time, maybe because they just didn't hate women hard enough to go full Patriarch. A lot of *them* saw our banner and rallied behind it, because one of the big things Cormorant promised was we'd end the suppression of the stronger sex; they only picked up the rest of the ideology in bits and pieces. So this was an army full of bitter men kept down by my sex all their lives going through unspeakably awful things and keeping up the fight anyway, without hardly any comfort or peace or anything else but their hard-earned convictions to keep 'em going. And I mean, it wasn't like I was some… blushing maid halfway through puberty. Our men had their needs; I had mine too. I guess it was just… sort of an unspoken agreement. If you're lucky enough to get paired up with a girl *and* have some downtime, she's yours to do what you want with so long as she's still fit to fight by the time you're through with her and you keep her safe in the field."

"That… wasn't an *official* policy, was it?"

"No, not really. If anyone had actually objected mil-pol would have come down harder than a sack of bricks, I don't doubt. *They* were Cormorant's through and through, and most of 'em ladyfolk to boot. Far as I know, nobody ever did complain. I guess we all just felt like it was a necessity of war like any other, to keep morale -- theirs *and* ours, mind -- from collapsing completely. And the higher-ups knew this way the boys wouldn't end up making use of civvie women, so they tolerated it as long as we did. They'd kind of unofficially pass us around, make sure none of the boys were left out. But they never gave us orders to or anything. It was all basically under the table."

"Were *all* your male soldiers rapists?"

I sigh. "Shal, it's… it's complicated. It's complicated because it wasn't always like that. It wasn't always the man who'd start things, it wasn't always -- or even very often -- by force, even then it was almost never really, I don't know, hostile. Some of the boys, they'd always ask first and they'd take 'please, no, I'm too tired right now' like perfect gentlemen. Some would just shove you up against a wall first chance they got and slap you around if you whined about it, but they'd sit and clean your gun and trade morbid jokes with you while you pulled yourself back together, and you'd know plain from then on they wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for you. And some were just so good at teasing and winding you up that it felt kind of exciting when they finally pulled up your uniform.

"Sometimes it hurt and I'd just cry and cry but the boy would lay there with me and hold me close 'til I felt better, and I'd just cling to him for the rest of the day if I could. Sometimes I just felt nothing at all and the whole thing barely registered in my head. Sometimes it was just another chore to get over with before shipping out. Sometimes I-- well, it wasn't like they were an unattractive lot, or… unskilled. If you're going to spend your day up to your ankles in corpses, you might as well start it off with a climax or two. Sometimes that was the nicest part of my day, something to look forward to because I knew it'd start to feel good before he was through with me.

"And sometimes… I mean, shit, taking a cock feels a lot better than taking a bullet no matter the context. The sex just felt so trivial compared to what we were going out in every day that I didn't think much about it. Like bruising an elbow when you're being hauled off on a stretcher with a broken rib. Ash, sometimes I'd *tell* the boys outright to make it hurt so's it'd take my mind off my wounds. All in all, as long as we kept enough whorelily in supply for everyone, me and a lot of the other women, well -- we all kind of agreed more or less, it just felt like doing our duty for our comrades. We cared about them and they cared about us, a lot, and anyway it was hardly the worst part of the day even if we didn't enjoy ourselves. And sometimes it *was* fun. Do you… do you get, maybe, why this just isn't a big deal to me?"

Shalvan slowly nods. "I… yes. I think I was thrown off by the word *rape;* I understand why you did not wish to describe your… experiences that way. Ranuir has a more… nuanced vocabulary, and 'rape' translates in our dictionary of Zia Ţai as the most extreme end of that continuum."

I sit back. The drugs are kicking in now; a soft glow of pleasure is washing over my brain and out through my limbs. The panic is receding. I feel grounded, safe in reality. "I like learning your words," I murmur. "It helps me get my head around things."

He smiles. "I suppose sharing a few more of them can't hurt. Do you know *latias?*"

I shake my head.

"*Lat* is simply the body, your physical substrate as an incarnate soul. *Ias* is somewhat more difficult to translate. Literally it is 'violation' but I believe the Zia Ţai word carries emotional baggage *ias* does not. 'Intrusion' perhaps is a better fit. We use the term *latias* to describe crossing the bodily boundaries of another. It is a broad term. It can describe many kinds of assault and cruelty, including rape, however--" he touches me on the arm "--this is also *latias*. Our way of greeting one another begins always with an act of *latias,* an uninvited touch by the, er, _varin_ to the _selin_ that invites a similar touch in return. Hm, I'm not sure how--"

I hold up a hand. "It's okay. Soshten explained those words to me. They are really impossible to translate."

"Ah! Excellent, then." He smiles, relieved. "That makes this considerably easier. Well, *latias* is ultimately a way of putting another in their place. _Val varinte, ash selinte,_ it says -- 'I am _varin,_ you are _selin._' That is not always a bad thing, and it is not always a good thing.

"What you… experienced with your… male comrades was certainly *latias,* when you did not invite their intrusion through words or body language. Now there is another term, *iastesh*, which we use to describe various… sexual impositions. But *iastesh* does not mean 'rape'. Perhaps this is a cultural distinction -- among the People, it is understood that we do not always know what is best for ourselves. Sometimes our friends, our partners, our comrades in arms know us well enough to know better. For *ias* to be punishable, it is not enough to show simply that a violation took place; you must also show that it harmed you in some manner."

"That is… very different, yes." I purse my lips. "Our laws place a great deal of importance on *strict* bodily autonomy. If we were on Republic soil, a lot of your coworkers would have already been arrested for how they treated us."

"I see. Your law makes the body sacrosanct then?"

"I mean, up to a certain point. Obviously if you're doing a crime the militia can cuff you and drag you off without doing anything illegal."

"Ah, I see. In the Society, 'bodily autonomy' is not a term in the, hm, moral equation, you might say. It is simply not a consideration. What is considered is hurt and harm. This means you can be punished for causing someone distress by touching them, but also that you can be punished for *not* touching someone if you knew that would prevent distress -- restraining an unwell woman intent upon harming herself, for instance."

I shift in my seat. "That… explains some things."

"Our system recognizes that individuals are different, and that context determines what is and is not permissible. There is not a simple listing of objective 'laws' that our citizens can memorize and execute like a computer program; we hold ourselves to higher standards, so that the concern is not 'what is legal' but rather 'what is right.' Which, to a *civilized* person, is usually the easier question. For instance, you concluded it was not right to send men you cared for to a horrible death in retaliation for how they violated you; given the context, our system would agree."

"Really? You sounded really shocked--"

"Only because I misunderstood what exactly they did to you. When you said 'rape' I heard this as _teshruh,_ a betrayal of your bonds of camaraderie and common purpose, a selfish, spiteful act of sexual cruelty and exploitation that traumatized and damaged you without concern for your wellbeing. Instead it sounds like what you're describing is what we would call _teshgat_; 'forced sex,' you might say."

"There's a difference?"

"To us, forced sex is not inherently an act of betrayal, nor is it even inherently cruel. Human sexuality is not simply a matter of... negotiating the experience of physical pleasure between two partners. *That* is prostitution, a crude profanement by commodification of something exalted. In real sex there is flirtation, seduction, deception -- sexuality is something of a game we play, which arouses the soul as well as the body. The same physical act can be vastly more enjoyable depending on what precedes it. You yourself described this, when you mentioned that some of your male comrades could even make you look forward to being… perhaps 'ravished' is an appropriate word?… by toying with your desires and anticipation."

"Okay, yeah, that makes sense so far. Where are you going with this?"

"What I'm getting at is sometimes forced sex can actually be *more* pleasurable for women, create a stronger bond than ordinary consensual sex, especially in the beginning stages of a relationship. Context is everything, of course, and _teshgat_ is more easily done wrong than right. But establishing a relationship is a matter of breaking down boundaries, creating a shared ground of intimacy between two souls, and this can be legitimately done by force. The way this usually plays out is there is a man and a woman, or more rarely two women, who share unresolved sexual tension; by flirting and various teasing forms of *latias,* the man can establish an emotional charge and a sense of anticipation in the woman, to the point where she experiences intrusive thoughts about him. Instead of allowing the relationship to form gradually, he takes bodily control of her while she is still trying to resist those intrusive thoughts instead of accepting the attraction, and forcing physical pleasure upon her until she stops resisting and starts enjoying herself. Once he releases her, the relationship essentially becomes a 'done deal'; she has been directly confronted with her attraction, she now associates him with strength, confidence, and physical pleasure, and on top of all this he has taken advantage of her neurological hardwiring. It is a dangerous way to try to establish a relationship but when it works it creates extremely strong bonds of affection and obedience, and close emotional bonds are very highly prized among the People.

"Now, I use this as an extreme example. Obviously this doesn't describe your interactions with…" He stops, apparently noticing my burning cheeks and averted gaze. "Ambassador?"

"I… it m-might describe… *some* of those, um. Interactions." I squeeze my thighs together awkwardly. "Um. What do you mean, taking advantage of 'neural hardwiring?'"

"Ah, I apologize; I am being unnecessarily cryptic. I simply mean the innate bonding process triggered by sexual intercourse, forced or otherwise."

"Innate… bonding? Sorry, I'm missing something here."

Shalvan gives me that goddamn look again. "Do you… forgive me, there must be some confusion, surely you know about--"

"Explain it as though I don't?"

"Very well. Stop me when you recognize what I'm talking about. Obviously there are profound and innate differences between the male and female psyche, somewhat more so among _uasdannar_ than _randannar_ as a result of our efforts to… ameliorate certain masculine excesses and feminine pathologies. One of these differences is that, for women, the sexual act physiologically triggers a response in the brain -- a release of oxytocin, among  other things -- that changes your disposition towards your partner. In effect, when you have sex with someone that results in climax, particularly penetrative sex with a… behaviorally masculine partner, you will start to like him more and feel progressively more attraction to him, even if overall you may still dislike him.

"What's important to understand is that this response is entirely involuntary. It doesn't matter who the man is, it doesn't matter how you feel about him beforehand, it doesn't matter if the intercourse is forcible or mutual." His expression turns solemn. "It is likely a survival mechanism conditioned by the  long periods of barbarity collective humanity intermittently suffers. As your race is… *infamously well aware*, women become ineluctably subjected to men during those grim intervals, due to the great imbalance in physical fragility and strength, and the rigors of motherhood without advanced medicine. But the trauma of repeated rape is catastrophic to the psyche, and without a 'failsafe' in the brain to trigger emergency pair-bonding, the chances of a woman in prolonged captivity — the state of most barbarian women — living long enough to pass on many of her genes are tragically lessened." He tilts his head. "Does this sound familiar yet?"

I stare at him. "What in all ash makes you *think* this?"

Shalvan looks perplexed. "Ah -- well, virtually every known galactic culture has treated this as 'common sense' knowledge, and it has been backed up by a great deal of research and experimentation. We understand the exact physiological mechanism and neuronal pathways involved and we've identified some of the genes responsible." He blinks several times. "Truly, you weren't aware--"

"Nobody ever told me that!" I burst out. "Nobody ever in all my life -- you're sure about this, that this isn't just a, a Green thing?"

"It is practically an axiom of modern psychology," Shalvan returns evenly. "One that is necessary to explain a wide variety of barbarian practices, such as bride raiding, and which we've found no exception to among any human race, from Zyahua to Chanjesu — the Rohara of old apparently even saw fit to *enhance* it, for reasons I decline to speculate upon. The mechanism is very deeply embedded, clearly dating to our presentience."

I stare at my hands. "Why did no one tell me this," I mumble, my eyes unfocused. Shalvan touches my thigh softly.

"Perhaps this is simply not common knowledge in the Empire. A completely female-dominated culture would need some level of self-deception to remain that way in the long term; the position of the sexes under the Imperial system could easily give rise to a… distorted… narrative…" Shalvan trails off.

I'm hunched on the couch, my arms tight around my legs, shrinking back against the seat. Even the warm, comforting haze of the not-opium can only do so much to blunt the sharp edges of the thoughts that are scraping across my soul. I don't look up when Shalvan perches on the couch next to me, takes my hand in his and squeezes softly. "Kestrel?" he says after a moment.

"Yeah?" I whisper, unable to meet his gaze.

"Talk to me, if you can."

"Nobody told me. Nobody-- I never knew--" I take deep breaths, try to stop myself from hyperventilating. "Shalvan, you're telling me any guy -- fuck, maybe even any old Guard bitch -- could have just taken me and kept me prisoner and raped me over and over and eventually *I would have started to like it.* Fuck, they *still could, fuck--*"

"Kestrel! Kestrel." He squeezes my hand tightly. "Nobody is going to hurt you. We will not let anybody hurt you; we will not let anyone take advantage of you. Your people are here. You have a bodyguard -- two bodyguards, to judge from the size of your chief of staff -- and you have us. Your safety is one of our highest priorities. There will always be someone who can come running to protect you and on Tel Casran no enemy will be able to reach you. No matter what else, right now *you are safe.*"

My jaw is trembling and I nearly bite my tongue as I try to speak. "All those years. All those years I didn't know. I was out in the open and anyone could have just-- God, my people-- *Sparrow--*"

"Shh. You saved Sparrow." Shalvan puts an arm around me and instinctively I crumple against him, shivering. "Nobody got to you."

"Shal I have been held down and fucked by men ten times stronger than me, I have been a prisoner of war, I've been strapped to a gurney so's a doc could cut into me and stitch up a torn vein, I have been in so many different fucked-up situations and I have never, never felt so fucking *helpless* as I do right now. Never."

"Why is that? What about this new information makes you feel helpless?"

"Because I was always *me.* I always had my mind, my soul, wasn't nobody could take that away from me. I knew what was right and what we were fighting for and there was no pain, no torture in the world could change me if I didn't let it. That's what I thought this whole time, that's what I clung to in my worst moments, and now you're telling me--" Now I *am* hyperventilating, I realize. I struggle for control, trying to slow my breathing before I pass out. "You're telling me that was all an illusion. You're telling me being a woman means I'm just-- I'm vulnerable and there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, God--"

"Shh, no. No, no, Kestrel; it's not that bad. Listen, listen." He squeezes my hand tightly, patting me on the shoulder. "Humans are an old species. Our brains, our mentalities have several different layers to them. At the core is the *uasmad,* the… the animal, the id, the beast, the atavistic core from which all our greatest passions and desires and worst instincts arise. But it lies beneath a superstrate of intellect that makes us creatures of reason, able to override our bestial impulses as no mere animal can. For some of us there is another layer, a lattice of strictures that is itself a product of that intellect, imposed through eugenics or genetic engineering. Then at the very top is one last layer of our sentience, a layer that changes and grows and becomes more complex for as long as we live. That is our identity, our personality.

"The part of a woman that makes her bond to a sexual captor is in that animalistic core. It's part of you the same way as a man's urge to murder another who has disparaged his honor is part of me. Or the urges we all share, to eat when we are hungry and drink when we are thirsty. These instincts are powerful of course, but they are still the basest part of us. That means they are subordinate to the higher layers. No matter how hungry you might be, you can always keep yourself from eating food you know is poisoned.


"We teach that our dark side is not a burden, but a gift. It is a deep well of passion, drive, ambition, and pleasure -- albeit one that must be managed responsibly, not allowed to overcome that part of the soul which walks in light. We teach our children from a very young age about their dark side, and we teach them how to control it, how to keep from being overwhelmed by black urges and intrusive thoughts. This requires lifelong vigilance, and discipline, and a careful understanding of the soul, but it can be done and our entire civilization is proof of this; we have all but eliminated the many great evils that spring from the darkness of the human soul and plague other civilizations to this day. Greed, egotism, arrogance, sociopathy -- all trouble us little, and we can turn our attention to higher things.

"I understand your fear, and I regret with all my heart that I spoke carelessly and frightened you so. But you are not so helpless as you think, nor so vulnerable. When our teenage girls go through puberty, we teach them carefully about their own bodies and psyches, and how they differ from their male comrades. We teach that sexual intimacy is something you must approach with more care and vigilance than must a man. We teach how your bonding instinct affects your emotions and might sway your reasoning in an unguarded moment, how to spot the signature traces of unreason it leaves upon your thoughts. We teach how to select partners carefully, how to spot the signs that someone is misusing your bonding instinct to control you against your best interest, and we encourage girls to experiment with one another before they risk higher-stakes relationships with boys. None of this can neuter your bonding instinct and take away its power over you; that is part and parcel of your womanhood. But it can shift the balance of power away from your *uasmad,* your id, and towards your conscious, rational mind. And it can change your bonding instinct from a vulnerability you live in fear of, into a tool you can choose to employ for your own social and emotional betterment. If it would bring you comfort I can provide you this same training before you venture out again into the world."

"Yes. Please. If you think it will help me."

"I do. If nothing else it should certainly restore your confidence in your own judgment."

Slowly, I let my legs drop to the floor. I'm still resting against Shalvan's shoulder, and he passes me a handkerchief to wipe my runny nose. "What do you mean about making… making my bonding instinct into a 'tool?'"

"Well, one of the most common functions of sex in our culture is to improve social and military cohesion. For instance, an executive officer might submit sexually to her commanding officer to improve their working relationship and to create a deeper psychological pressure to obey his orders. Synchronizing military rank with social role orientation is quite helpful in the field, we've found; it reinforces discipline dramatically, especially in units with low morale or suffering exhaustion, since they can then actually *rely* on their base instincts instead of burning willpower trying to suppress them for the sake of the military hierarchy. This is actually one of the many reasons we default to male-female CO-XO pairs where possible."

I stare up at him. "You let… oh my God, I have *so* many questions."

He laughs. "Perhaps you can make a list, and Comrade Nishuin will be able to help you answer them. Ah, speaking of Nishuin: It does not escape my attention that I have now several times caused you emotional injury due to my extreme ignorance of your culture. This is completely unacceptable; it is the precise *opposite* of my purpose here, and so I would like to ask you if you would be comfortable with Comrade Nishuin attending some of these sessions. I would share my notes with her to some extent and use her feedback to better prepare a course of treatment. Obviously this is a very intimate thing to involve another person in, and I realize that intimacy poses certain challenges for you, so I wished to bring up the possibility and give you some time to consider it before you make a decision. But I would strongly encourage it, particularly as Nishuin is attached to your embassy, while I am of course bound to this base and will not be able to maintain continuity of care once you depart the planet."

"Uh… wow, okay. She's really okay with that idea?"

"I have not broached the subject out of respect for your confidentiality, but she will of course be willing to assist."

"H-how do you know that?"

"Culture Liaison is her role. It is what she is here for."

"She's Liaison to the *Embassy*. Not to… not for my personal life! That's--"

"Not a meaningful distinction to us. In any case, it is no secret she admires you greatly." He smiles. "I am certain she would leap at any chance to be of use to you."

"Okay, well. Um. I'll… I'll think about it. It… would be good to have someone here who… who understands these things about us, I just…"

"I understand. Please take all the time you need."


"Shalvan… explained to me what this… relationship really means. I…" I fiddle with my hair awkwardly. ""


"You can *rebuild* folks' *whole bodies*?" I sit bolt upright. "How-- how is that even-- how do you *do* that?"

She shrugs. "Kess, I'm not a surgeon. That's really advanced stuff, I barely know anything about it. The only medicine I know is basic field work."

"Soshi, we have so many people -- boys paralyzed by explosions, folks who jumped on grenades and lost their limbs. One of my friends, we had to give him Shuharva's mercy because he-he--" The tears are welling up already. "He couldn't see and he couldn't hear and he couldn't move; he was just trapped inside what little was left of his mangled body. And you're saying he didn't have to die, you could have saved him--"

"We have the tech for it, yeah. For our own people, anyway. I met a man once who lost most of his body fighting a fire and you'd never know anything bad had happened to him just to look."

"Why didn't-- you could have *given us this,* you could have told us how-- none of those people, those brave soldiers, those poor civvies in the wrong place at the wrong time-- all those arms torn off and eyes lost to shrapnel and fucking field amputations--" I breathe deeply, fighting to keep myself under control, but the words are spilling out faster than I can even think them. "God, Soshi, you gotta help us, there's so many people--"

*"Kess."* Soshi grabs me by the shoulders. "Kess, stop. *Breathe.* Listen, okay? Listen to me. Please? Just let me talk for a minute."

My mouth moves silently for a moment, then I crumple back against the wall. "Okay," I whisper, my voice cracking.

"Look. This… please, I get it, I really think I do, I understand why you're so upset, so… this." She screws up her face in frustration, making a gesture I don't understand; I wonder distantly if she doesn't know the right words. "I get how important this must be to you. But this is… Kess, I'm *just a soldier.* I'm just an embassy guard. The things you're talking about? This is *really high-level stuff.* We have one clinic, *one*, in our entire volume that can do body reconstruction, on Tel Casran. They do, I don't know, maybe ten major procedures a year. This kind of stuff, we almost *never* need it. It's *rare* for us to get injured so badly. I know you want to help your people, this must feel so unfair, but we literally do not have the capacity. We can't medevac thousands of your soldiers to Tel Casran and treat them all. That would take… decades, maybe centuries depending on how many critically wounded you have. And it would take enough resources to bankrupt a planet. Space travel isn't easy and it's not very safe and these surgeries take a lot of manpower, energy, tech, resources, and we're not used to doing things *en masse* like this, we just don't have the procedures for it. And that's not even getting into the politics of letting so many *uassurinar* into our capital.

"As for sharing this tech with you, I'm not sure you realize what you're asking here. That's a huge, political question. It's way over my head. I'm just an embassy guard, I can't talk about this stuff, I can't *negotiate* with you." She squeezes my arm. "Talk to Nishuin, okay? This is her job. She can give you real answers and she can arrange a meeting with the actual Ambassador for you to negotiate with."

I close my eyes, breathing deeply for a while. As my adrenaline slowly recedes, I start feeling *really* stupid.

"I'm sorry, Soshi."

"Shh. It's okay."

"That was really… stupid and selfish and unfair of me. I wasn't thinking at all. I'm sorry for treating you like… like you *are* the Society. Just, the way you talk, the way you all know so much, you're all on the same page -- I'm really not used to that and it really messes with my thinking. I'm sorry."

*"It's okay.* I understand, Kess."

"Do you think…" I swallow hard. "Do you think we'll be able to figure something out? To help my people?"

She sighs. "We all *want* to help. Everyone from Nishuin to the Ambassador to the Big Three themselves. I'm sure if you ask, they'll try to find *some* way of helping your people within the rules. They wouldn't be in that position if they were so callous as to say, 'no, they're not special enough.'"

"But?"

"But it's complicated. We have to put our own safety, our own culture and supremacy first. What if the tech you want, what if it can do things besides heal people? What if it could be used as a weapon? Maybe even against us! There's a *reason* we don't just uplift all our allies to the same level we're on. It would mean catastrophe -- for us, for the cause, for the *Galaxy.* Some powers *have* to be reserved to us, because we're the only ones who *can* keep them safe, keep them aimed in the right direction.


"Tech transfer is…" Nishuin sucks air through her teeth, shaking her head. "It is *never* undertaken lightly, and requires approval at the highest levels. The only reason we can even *discuss* this is we *amended our constitution* shortly after the war. Before, tech transfer would have been categorically impossible. What if it turned out the tech we gave you could be used for creating bioweapons? Can we trust that you will never use that technology in a way that would harm our interests? Can we trust that your government would keep it from falling into the wrong hands? Can *you?*

"And, frankly, tech transfer is only part of the equation. We are a highly advanced nation, Comrade Ambassador; our infrastructure is entirely unlike anything to be found on your planet. Even if we *did* give you the technologies you want, there is no guarantee you would be able to use them without perhaps centuries of building out new infrastructure and training new personnel. Virtually all of our technology rests on miniaturized computers, which even in the macroscale form factor require microprocessor foundries, standardized operating systems, communication protocols, and so on. And the less said of the molectronic systems, the better. Simply transplanting technology from one culture to another, *even if* they are at the same general level of technical attainment and infrastructural complexity, is almost never possible unless the cultures have gone to the effort of maintaining both parity and *interoperability* between their systems of infrastructure. Consider crude oil -- while a plentiful, relatively compact source of dirty energy on 'old growth' greenhouse worlds, it has long been considered worthless on the general market, sometimes even for cross-region trade, due to differences in composition and quality between various sources and extraction processes. Whole systems of infrastructure must be tightly attuned to the composition of local sources to be able to produce tradeworthy plastics and fuels.

"Culture also cannot be overlooked. I have the utmost respect for your people, Comrade Ambassador, you are no barbarians, but the unfortunate fact remains that you are culturally yet primitive. A certain level of cultural and philosophical sophistication is required to be able to handle many technologies responsibly. Otherwise, the shock of their sudden introduction can spawn pathologies throughout the cultural environment, which can themselves impede or even fatally arrest the natural development of culture towards a point where it would become possible to wield the technology maturely and effectively -- this in particular is why we have a standing moratorium on helping other cultures establish pervasive communication grids for civilian use. Understand, I speak not of hypotheses. We have *made* these mistakes, long ago. We have *watched* this happen. The price was beyond all accounting.

"The ability to customize and endlessly rebuild one's body is *disruptive.* You have a population of several billion. Your one, strained ecosystem shelters a greater host of human life than the Society in full. Could you handle a sudden dramatic rise in lifespans? Could you handle the strain that the demand for reconstructive services would put on your economy and planetary ecosphere? Could you handle the social repercussions of triaging or otherwise rationing access to the technology? Rebellions have erupted over less.

"Consequently, I do not believe that tech transfer would be a productive topic to discuss with our Ambassador. *However,* let us not lose sight of the concrete problem you wish to address. There may be ways for you to get what you want for your people without confronting any of the risks or complexities inherent in tech transfer."

My heart has been sinking throughout her speech, but I feel a sudden manic flash of hope. "What would you suggest?"

"Offhand? While we undoubtedly have the most *sophisticated* bodily reconstruction technologies in the Socialist world, there are other polities in the Socialist League and without which have developed the same basic technique. For instance, the Unitary Authority of Diamond. They have a much larger population than we do, and while they do not have the scientific and intellectual resources of Topaz, their systems of government and organization are such that it is very easy for them to adopt and iterate on new technologies and ideas, and they work closely with the Topazan scholarly world. One of these technologies is organ and body reconstruction, and unlike us they are equipped to use it on a much wider scale. I was privileged to observe some of the early human trials, and I can attest that their methods consistently produce an acceptable quality of outcome.

"My suggestion is therefore this: speak with the UA Diamond's ambassador when you arrive on Tel Casran. Diamond is a deeply militarized culture that prizes honor, chivalry, and martial prowess as cardinal virtues, whose population all serve time in the armed forces -- honorable service is in fact the only reliable route to high office." She smiles. "Given your background -- and sex -- I can more or less *guarantee* that Diamond's ambassador will *jump* at the chance to meet you, and will be very receptive to any request you make of him for aid."

I sigh. "I don't like flaunting my womanhood at friendlies like that. Making innocent men feel threatened just to get what I want feels wrong to me. But I suppose if that's what it takes--"

"That is not what I mean at all! Perhaps you misunderstood -- Diamond has been a League world for centuries and no longer upholds traditional Zyahua gender norms. Men will not feel threatened by you; "

"Are you telling me this planet is run by... *unreconstructed masculists?"* I manage faintly.

"No, no! You mistake me. Ambassador, I spent several months on Diamond during my training as a Liaison. I can assure you it is a civilized world and an entirely unobjectionable place to be a woman. I will say that Diamond's men are… perhaps overly flirtatious; physical and possessive. I can imagine that might perhaps cause a Zyahua woman to feel threatened or assaulted. Personally, however, I enjoyed my time among them. I should note also that Diamondite men are *very* protective of us, and would intervene immediately if they were to witness a woman -- especially one of their own, or a Society citizen -- being mistreated. They revile the Patriarchs no less than any other majority-Zyahua culture.


I'm swept away from the battlefield by a jarring tone, a noise that's coming from everywhere and nowhere, growing louder as the landscape of carnage and twisted metal dims and recedes into the fog. My lungs are gasping for air and I lunge forward, looking back and forth wildly, and I catch a glimpse of light.

I clutch my own body. The wounds and dirt are gone, my uniform gone. My skin is wrapped in a tight fabric, smoother than silk, covering most of my body except my head and hands. As I fumble in the blackness I feel someone beside me -- a woman, judging by the softness of her skin and the slimness of her arms. She's unmoving, breathing slowly. Reflexively I check her pulse. Irregular heartbeat. A casualty? Adrenaline surging once more, I move to straddle her, hands moving for my medkit, only for my legs to get caught in the blankets—

Blankets.

I breathe deeply.

I was in bed. I just woke up.

How long was I out? I must have been medevac'd--

Wait. No.

How much of that was a dream?

The noise, an insistent chirping, is still there, but it's quieter now, relegated to the background, not consuming my universe. I rub enough sleep from my eyes to be able to focus in the dark.  I stare at the woman I'm straddling, looking for some kind of clue, and I find it in her face.

*Soshten.*

I collapse back into bed, breathing hard, clutching my face and nearly sobbing with relief as my brain finally puts the pieces back together, true memories  bursting to the surface and surrounding the false ones. The violence of my landing is enough that Soshten stirs, and she sits up, head cocked.

"Mmh. Kess. Door."

"Wha…?"

She spares me a glance, a low light rising in the little dormitory as her fingers find a bedside control. "…I'll get it," she murmurs, patting me on the shoulder.

I still feel slightly dizzy as I hear the door slide back. The hallway outside is dimly lit with silver light that makes me think of moonlight. I hear a woman's voice, and sit up.

"--deeply apologize fo--" A strangled halt. _"Soshten-surin?"_

_"Nishuin-surin."_ Soshten's leaning in the doorway, at ease in very little clothing. She slaps Nishuin on the shoulder. _"Sona valari til atgano val case."_

_"Lahi narai elena risesh, surin!"_ Nishuin bows deeply, returning the gesture and then clasping her hands together. _"Mol mase. Niltasha shirane."_

Soshten steps back, blinking in surprise. _"Ehe, shos."_ She glances at me. "Kess. Something's up."

I stare blearily at the two women. "Up? What…?"

Nishuin hesitates for a moment, then crosses the threshold. Soshten reacts immediately and violently, grabbing Nishuin by the throat and shoving her against a wall with her free hand. _"Nishi!"_ she erupts, sounding genuinely *furious.* _"Hal shose!?"_

That's worth at least a cup or two of deep black tea. Before I know it I'm on my feet, momentarily disoriented as I try to compensate for a war wound my suit is already compensating for. I catch myself and close the distance to the two _rantashar._ "What the *fuck* has gotten into you, Soshi?" I demand. She spares me a dumbfounded glance. "You know she's a friendly, right? Fuck, I thought I was supposed to be the crazy one here--"

Nishuin has her hands up, as if in a gesture of surrender. "Peace, peace. Do not fault her, ambassador; she acted only to protect the sanctity of your ho-- your, eh, hm, r-residence? I acted in haste when I should have communicated. The blame is mine."

"Can you please let her go? It's okay." I touch Soshten by the arm. She gives me a dubious look.

"She has your permission to come in?"

"Yes! Yes, she has my permission." I rub my forehead as Soshten reluctantly lets go of Nishuin's throat. "Matikhe's swollen balls, is that was this is about? Some weird territorial--"

"If I may." Nishuin touches us both softly on the shoulder. "I wish to explain, but time is a factor. Would you walk with me?"

I glance at Soshten, whose expression makes me think of a kicked _pien şai_. "Yeah." I take her hand and squeeze it, and she brightens up a bit. "Can Soshi-- um, Comrade Soshten accompany us?"

"Please." Nishuin seems completely unruffled by the assault. We follow her out into the hallway, Soshten only bothering to pull on a light cardigan as a concession to decency -- or perhaps temperature. Wherever my liaison is going, she's in a hurry; keeping up is even more difficult than before.

"I'm… sorry about that," Soshten murmurs to us both. "It seems like I… I misunderstood something."

"Think nothing of it. Your action was proper." Nishuin squeezes her arm gently. "Ambassador, you must understand: among our people, the… place in which a citizen customarily sleeps, I suppose, is inviolate. To cross the threshold without vocal acquiescence -- usually by a specific set phrase -- is not merely violation but assault, an act of violence against the person. Whether or not she is present."

Soshten nods silently.

"I know this is not so in your culture, and I interpreted your response as implicit permission for me to draw near." She hesitates, and glances uncertainly at me. I nod reassuringly.
 
 "Correctly so."

She looks relieved, and continues. "The role of liaison is unique in that we are not merely permitted, but required to transgress against strictures that bind any well-raised citizen more strongly than steel, and without flinching or otherwise showing disrespect to the alien cultures we are dispatched to. Learning to do so is the hardest part of the training, and even the most experienced of us struggle with it.  I… was not expecting you to be accompanied by another of the People, and I was not in the right mindframe for dealing with complex cross-culture interactions. A function of surprise and fatigue."

"So you do get tired, huh."

Nishuin smiles. "We have accomplished many things through the Ranshavlin, but I think sleep will be with us for a long time to come. For one, I do not mind."

"I meant you personally, Nishuin," I tell her. Soshten snickers.

*"Oh.* I see." A quiet, tittering laugh. "As I was saying -- I failed to factor in Soshten's presence and her lack of cultural instruction. Given that context her anger and her forceful reaction were entirely justified. She seems quite possessive of you, to jump so quickly to your defense." There's a note of amusement in her voice now. "You are a fortunate woman, comrade. This way."

I glance at Soshten. She looks away, flushing slightly. "Does the whole embassy know we're sleeping together?" I ask plaintively.

"No, no," Nishuin assures me. "It was simply obvious from context."

"You *said* there was a *situation, Nishuin,*" says Soshten loudly.

"Quite so. I do apologize for rousing you at an uncivilized hour, ambassador; I hope you will not take this as disrespect--"

I wave her away. "If anything, you did me a favor. Has something happened with my people?"

"Hm. Yes, in a way. Not your staff here in the embassy, but--" She stops, touching her fingers to a plate by a door. After a moment it lights up green around the edges and the door unlocks. She slides it back and beckons us to follow her inside.

This room is brighter than the hallway. It's a conference room, with gigantic display panels covering most of the curved walls, the rest being frosted-glass window. The panels are all lit, and while the script is alien and the icons largely unrecognizable, the visual and kinetic structure of some of the readouts is all too familiar. There are five people already here, two operating sleek terminals built into the conference table.

At the head of the table, the ambassador rises to great me.

"Kestrel-comrade. Thank you for coming. I apologize for disrupting your sleep." She touches me on the shoulder; I touch hers in turn. Her voice is soft, but there is no trace of warmth in her eyes, and her expression is troubled.

"I hope I can be of service, _Lifuin-niltash_. What's the situation?"

She turns, gesturing to one of the wall panels. "Do you know what this is?"

"That looks like a radar disc." I purse my lips. "Sort of."

"Many sensor technologies are integrated here, but you will lose no critical insight if you think of it as radar." She indicates a pattern of dots on the screen. "Colors represent IFF signals for local powers. Our assets are coded green, suspected Imperial assets are coded red, League assets -- your Republic included -- are coded blue."

There's something off about how she says "your Republic" that sets off all kinds of alarms in my head.

The ambassador taps the screen. "This thick line is the boundary between sovereign Society airspace and the external portion of our aircraft identification zone. Per our understanding with your Republic, as a diplomatic courtesy, Destiny Garden is *supposed* to contact us in advance if your aircraft are to enter our ADID zone."

I gaze at the radar, at the blue dots swarming through the identification zone, a white glyph blinking urgently in their centers. "You weren't given notice."

"Friendly flyovers are rare. Your air force has little business here; it is an unpopulated area where we handle the routine patrols and share the data from our local ISR assets -- a collection of aerostats, the embassy drone swarm, and a geostationary satellite -- as part of the same courtesy."

"And those aren't recon flights. Way too many bogies, way too close together. Do you have eyes on them? Any idea what line--"

A smile flashes briefly across Lifuin's face. It's like part of her wants to drop the cold, professional facade and talk shop with me over drinks. Instead, she says, "Those are Shatterhawks, if the name means anything to you."

*Crap.*

The Shatterhawk. Local design, League engineering and tech. Vertical take-off and landing. Able to switch between hover and high-speed scramjet flight in seconds. They're gunships, able to random-walk fast enough that orbital precision assets can't hit them, meant to get from one place to another in the blink of an eye and then unload white hot death on the adversary while her ears are still ringing from the sonic boom. Precision-tailored to beat Guard ass into bloody submission.

There's over thirty blue dots on the screen, moving fast. I didn't realize we had that many in service already. Last I heard we were still in the prototype stage. I guess Silverdawn liked her new toys.

"I want to believe this is just a breach of diplomatic protocol. It's the most likely explanation." Lifuin indicates the lines stretching out behind the flock of Shatterhawks, tracing their paths. "None of their flight plans appear to intersect our airspace. If things continue as they are, the aircraft will pass out of our identification zone in around fifteen minutes."

"If." I turn my gaze back to her. She nods, still staring at the screen.

"In under three mintues, the airfleet will be in a position where they can adjust their trajectories such that they will *all* converge on the Embassy at the same time. From multiple angles, arriving nearly simultaneously. If they make that course-correction, we will have less than a minute of notice. *Ambassador, this does not sit well with me.*"

I feel suddenly cold.

"Get Silverdawn on the line," I say quietly. *"Now.* Make whatever threats you need to to get her awake and talking. I will own the fallout."

Lifuin half-turns towards the conference table, snapping her fingers. Someone lifts a handset from its receiver and begins issuing commands.

"You see what I see," she says softly.

"The thing about battle that makes it so goddamn terrifying," I mutter, "is all the noise and flying dirt. The darkness and the muck. In broad daylight it's bad enough. When shit goes down you have so much you have to figure out and you have a split *second* to do it in if you're lucky. There's no time to think. You have to figure out where the shots are coming from. What cover is safe. And you have to do it all on instinct. Civvies freeze up in that kind of stress. And standing still on a battlefield is the fastest way in God's Creation for a man to die." I look at Lifuin, and this time she meets my eyes. "Tonight, that fog of war is our treaty -- and my presence. And someone's hoping you're that civvie who can't make hard calls fast enough."

"Kestrel," she says, her voice quiet, and this time it's Lifuin talking, not the Society of Worlds Ambassador & League Emissary to the Popular Republic of Sapphire. "Your honest opinion."

"Yes?"

"Would your government *do* this? Is your president… would she turn on us?"

I stare at the floor for a little bit too long. Lifuin's posture shifts. Alarm.

Silverdawn is capable of *anything*, if she truly believes it's for the good of the people. It's why I put her in charge.

I knew she could make the calls I couldn't.

"You get why I need to talk to her," I say finally. 

Lifuin nods.

"Ambassador," I murmur.

"Yes?"

"Are those 'Hawks a serious threat to you?"

"That," Lifuin answers weakly, "depends entirely on how long we wait to start shooting."

"Do you… have air raid shelters?" I ask, wincing a bit at my own question. *Air raid shelters* on an embassy campus? And here I was trying not to come across like a bloodthirsty, out-of-touch old soldier--

To my surprise, she nods. Aloud, she snaps an order in Ranuir. Then to me: "Everyone except T-zero personnel will be evacuated to the shelters. Your people included."

"Can you make an exception? For Jay and Bear?" I clasp my hands behind my back. "I think I might need them."

She nods, distant. She calls out another order. "They will be escorted to us."

"Thank you."

Her eyes fix on mine again. "Thank *you,* Kestrel," she replies. "I hope I am not asking you to face your fears for us."

I smile weakly. "If it's to be a donnybrook, a fancy Green base is an outright luxurious place to watch the fireworks from, by my standards."

She takes me by the shoulder, pulling me to one side. She lowers her voice. "Kestrel. Your strength of character is admirable, truly, but if at any point you require assistance or psychiatric attention, please notify myself or a member of my staff *immediately.* I would have you understand, you are of the most assistance to us lucid and well, and I would not see your compromise this for the sake of appearances. None here will think less of you if you need to step aside at any point; on this you have my solemn word of honor. Are we understood?"

I think of Shalvan. My instinct is to argue, to push back and make light. Instead, I nod. "Yes, ma'am."

"Good. We will protect you with our lives, I give you my oath." She says it so easily, I almost don't process the magnitude of her words. Her eyes turn to Soshten, standing awkwardly by the door, and beckons. Startled, the younger woman approaches. "Comrade. Set aside your ordinary responsibilites. You will serve on the Ambassador's personal security detail, at least until this crisis is averted."

Soshten's eyes widen. "Yes, ma'am!" she says eagerly. "Do we have reason to believe Kestrel-*surin* is in danger?"

"I have reason to believe we're *all* in danger," the Ambassador responds. "But if our fears are correct, Kestrel will be more than an Ambassador tonight." Her eyes fix on Soshten's. "She will be a *witness."*

Soshten swallows, a hint of alarm flitting across her face. "Understood, ma'am. I'll retrieve my combat gear--"

"No. Remain here. Do not leave her side." Lifuin gestures to an unoccupied adjutant. "Tanshen will retrieve your armor and weapons." She repeats the order in Ranuir, and Tanshen bows as he backs away, then darts from the room. She turns to Ranvar, who is watching the ISR screens with a hard expression. "Commander. I want a full sweep of the base. Assume our internal sensors are compromised."

The chief of security turns, raising her eyebrows as she reaches for her handset. "You suspect the base has been penetrated?" she responds in Zia Ţai, apparently cued by Lifuin. "By whom?"

"I will take no chances. Assume Sapphirian agents." Lifuin glances at me unhappily. "The most likely case would be assassins targeting Kestrel-ambassador, though the involvement of a third power is not implausible. If you find any intruders, take them alive if you can -- but take no risks you are not comfortable with in doing so."

*"Coshvin, san!"* Ranvar gazes at me for a moment, expression impenetrable. "I'll organize the sweep personally." She moves away towards a free console, issuing urgent orders into her handset.

Everything is slowly coming together. Silverdawn has been covetous of Society tech for as long as I've known her. Even during the war, she complained to me about how stingy the League was with its technology. She felt they were giving us too little, even as I was reeling at the sheer extent of the new capacities they were bestowing upon us out of nothing but diplomatic goodwill. A Society embassy probably wouldn't have blueprints for hypersonic missiles or amat stocks lying around, but the tech and materials in their weapons and armor -- even their civilian technologies -- the amount of materiel to be found here would be worth a queen's ransom even to the black market. To a struggling young nation, with a ruthless leader hungry for power and status, it might just be priceless.

And she would finally have an excuse to be rid of the woman holding her leash. The great Kestrel Winterblossom, dying heroically for people in one last dramatic black op. No one would even know I had opposed her. She might even be able to use my death to rally the people against the Society.

I feel sick.

*This is all my fault.*

How long has she been planning this grand betrayal? Is this why she was so eager for me to become ambassador to the League? How did she accomplish all this under my nose? I know I'm not as popular with some parts of the military as I used to be, but could she have really convinced enough soldiers to keep quiet about something on this scale?

I steady myself. Peace has brought many changes, but one thing is as it ever was. I am still the last resort of my people.

A republic -- a land where sovereignty lies in the people, where rule of law prevails over rule of woman -- that was always Cormorant's great dream. We made that dream come true, but it is still so fragile. So many times I have held my tongue, restrained myself from rash action because my interference would threaten everything we fought and bled and died for. Because whatever petty tyrannies Silverdawn sought to wreak upon the world, defying her mandate to rule would have been worse.

But there is a plan in place all the same. I feel nauseous even thinking about it, but I am no longer blessed with the naïveté to believe that nothing could be worse than giving up on the Cormorant's dream.

It is always a commander's lot to choose who lives and who dies. Sometimes you must accept the intolerable, in order to avert the unthinkable.

I've let Silverdawn get away with a lot. But she's finally pushed me too far.

The only question is whether I'll be able to execute from here, if I have to. I wasn't expecting to have my things confiscated, in particular the one-time pad sewn between layers of fabric in a cheap dress I wouldn't have been caught dead in. My communications with the outside world all depend on our hosts. But I suspect, if I decide the President needs to go, Lifuin will stand by me.

I take a deep breath. Maybe there's still a chance, a way I can make her back down. I have to hold onto that hope. I *cannot* pull that trigger if there's another way.

Everything will depend on our phone call.


"You've confirmed those are Shatterhawks?" She nods.  "And the IFF. How certain are you it's valid?"

"Fully. We have restricted but live access to your planetary defense grid, certain databases we share for the sake of mutual security. It's not just a matter of matching signatures -- the public keys are listed active in the IFF issuance register and match the craft transmitting."

Right. *Diplomatic courtesy.*

_"Niltash._ Silverdawn _osro vade."_

The ambassador beckons. A technician approaches; I flinch as she touches the small of my back and she backs away, holding up her hands, a small, curved device clutched in one.

*"Tch* -- I forget myself. Forgive the intrusion, comrade Ambassador." Lifuin sounds *stressed.* Understandable, given the circumstances, but it's a little bit fucking *terrifying* seeing the unflappable People showing *weakness.* "It is a headset. You may speak to your president without our voices intruding. Touch the contact by the earpiece if you need to take the conversation private; by the mouthpiece if you need to put her on hold."

I stare at the map in trepidation as the technician attaches the headset to my left ear, and then steps quickly away, bowing. The voice is so clear I almost spin to the left as it comes through.

"Office of the President. To whom am I speaking?"

I exhale softly. It's her secretary, Hazel.

"Haze. It's me, Kestrel. I need to speak to Silverdawn *right* this fucking instant."


Hazel's too young to have ever been a soldier, but that aggravating *frivolity,* that*indecisiveness* that plagues civilians is totally absent from her. She's sweet and she's fun but she's *hardcore.* She'll laugh and dance and sing with the best of them, but she doesn't mess around -- I have no doubt that if she were ever in a position where she had to kill, she wouldn't freeze up, she wouldn't panic, she wouldn't have a hysterical fit and get taken hostage. She'd *pull* that goddamn trigger and she'd save the sobbing breakdown for the nearest secure location.

I *like* Hazel. She's everything about civilians that I love, with none of the attendant frustrations.

Maybe she's the person I wish I'd had the chance to be.

"Understood," she answers briskly, and I can hear her flipping switches in the background. "Putting you through, Kess. Good luck."

There's a faint electric squawk on the line. I don't bother to give the president a chance to speak. "Silverdawn," I growl. "What the sublimated *fuck* are you doing?"

A yawn. "My *darling* General.* I am doing a great many things. *Sleeping*, foremost among them. It would *help* if you could make your wild accusations a touch more specific."

God *damn* it. I could fucking strangle her right now. This much on the line and she's *playing with me.* It's like a fucking compulsion with this woman.

"This is not the time for games." If I'd been holding a conventional phone, I'd be squeezing the cable in both hands like I wanted to do to her *neck.*

"And it's not the time for you to be *cryptic,* either!" She actually sounds as exasperated as I feel right now, which only makes me angrier. She's-- we're *both* probing, insisting on finding out just how much the other one knows, and she's not going to give.

We don't have time for this.

"Egret," I say quietly.

Dead silence. Yeah, that got her attention.

"An airfleet is approaching the Embassy Base. *Ours.* They violated the ident zone without prior notification, against diplomatic protocol. It looks like they're going to pull a last-minute course correction; if they do, it puts them on course to surround the base."

For a moment, she doesn't respond. Then: "What precisely is approaching, do you know? Have you identified the fleet composition?"

I suppress the urge to answer with a snippy "You tell me." "All Shatterhawks," I say instead.

"Hazel. Conference call," Egret instructs, ripping through a list of names and titles faster than I could have taken down. "Rouse them and get them online; I don't care what it takes. This is pri' violet."

Violet. The only higher priority code is *ultraviolet*, and protocol dictates it only be used in truly exceptional emergencies-atop-emergencies, where already active pri-violet cases are getting in the way of a prompt response to something dire. "On red" was our shorthand for "as soon as humanly possible if not sooner" back in the Army. "On violet" was "right this fucking instant" and as a rule it was not spoken calmly.

At least she's taking this mess seriously.

"Patching in Skymarshal Spring-Lotus," Hazel chirps. ""

A gruff male voice. "Comrade President. Comrade General."

"Comrade Marshal." Egret's voice is stiff. "We need to know what is going on at Location Verdant."

"Nothing, as far as I'm aware, ma'am."

"Check again. Where's our nearest aircraft to Verdant Bastion?"

A pause, some distant chatter. "Sable Bastion Two-Nine-Twelve, distance three-oh-seven klicks. It's an old Packhorse, carrying med tech to those holdouts we're trying to court," he replies, a note of disdain and irritation in his voice.

Egret wanted to overrun the Khmai nationalists and put them down by force, and the military was, for once, behind her 100%; if I hadn't put my foot down there would have been a bloodbath. Politically it wasn't a controversial call, I had the public's backing -- but internally, it cooled some of the enthusiasm certain quarters had for me. Marshal Spring-Lotus was probably one of them. Here's hoping he'll be professional, but wasting time on an emergency call so he can bitch and moan to the President -- so far, I'm not impressed with the man.

"And it's alone?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Comrade, I'm being told there are Shatterhawks menacing Society airspace. Kestrel, how many?"

"Thirty."

"Th-that must be a radar glitch," sputters the Marshal. "How have you identified these birds as 'Hawks?"

Lifuin breaks in. "IFF is broadcasting. The codes check out for the craft type."

"Ambassador Lifuin Cirsadi," I interject, for the Marshal's benefit. Maybe to intimidate him a little.

A sound like the Marshal is scratching his beard. "Those must be forged codes, ma'am. You'd have to rip out an IFF module to get a live one; we take those things seriously."

*Ass-covering? This is your first priority, at a time like this?*

"The codes *are* live, Marshal," Lifuin responds. I've been with the People long enough now to notice the subtle cadences in her voice that tell me she isn't much impressed with the man either. "The signatures are valid and the key fingerprints are as bound to various Shatterhawks in your database." A dangerous note slips into her voice. "Or at least, in the version you share with us."

A moment of stunned silence. "That-- that can't be right."

"Marshal," Egret says imperiously, "how many of our Shatterhawks can you *account* for?"

There's a long pause, filled only by indistinct voices, slowly rising into alarmed shouts. "Fuck," the Marshal breathes.

"Marshal. *What in Shuharva's name is going on?"*

"Unclear at this time." The Marshal sounds shaken. "Thirty-one 'Hawks are unaccounted for at Gilt Bastion. Th-the bloody *Shadowed Gorge* hangars."

"Thirty-*one?"* I hiss. Lifuin and I exchange glances.


"Lifuin," I say in a low voice. "I give you my solemn word of honor as a soldier and a diplomat that I will not share this information, but I *need* to know. Is there technology that could hide a gunship from your ISR? Technology we might have acquired somehow?"

She purses her lips. "To the best of my knowledge, only the Thalisan Union possesses the capability to outwit our sensoria, and then intermittently. It's why we call them the 'Echoes;' during the War, sensor echoes were sometimes the only sign of an impending attack." She notices my alarmed expression and adds hurriedly, "Our ISR complex has too long of a range for that tech to be in use. We would have seen sensorium glitches by now."

*The Shadows.* I rub my brow tiredly.


"Egret. I need your permission to make a call."

"You're asking *me* for *permission?"* She sounds simultaneously taken aback and amused.

"No," I growl. "I'm *telling* you *how to save face."*

"Now *that's* the Kestrel we know and…" She trails off, sighs. "Very well. I *will* hold you to account for the lives of those pilots, General. The materiel is yours to dispose of."

The Marshal sounds alarmed. "Comrade President — those 'Hawks are some of the most valuable tech in our possession, they're effectively a strategic asset—"

"Your advice is noted, Comrade Marshal," Egret says coolly. The Marshal sputters out.

Let it not be said her reputation is without its virtues.


"Ambassador!" Nishuin bows deeply. "Thank you for seeing me."

"No trouble." I beckon. "Come in?"

She shakes her head. "I would not trouble you! I had only a brief question regarding a potentially sensitive matter -- if I might?"

"Shoot."

"Your nudity taboo—"

Ohh no.

"—does it extend to bathing? Showering, to be precise? In the company of others?"

I pinch the bridge of my nose, exhaling deeply. *I should have seen this coming.*

"How bad is it?"

"Mm." Nishuin purses her lips unhappily. "Perhaps it would be best if I were to show you."

I step out into the hall and close the door behind me. "I suppose I should have clued in over the lack of washrooms in our bedr— our dormitories."

Nishuin nods. "Of course, our guest suites—" Her gesture encompasses the common area and its the surrounding facilities "—are each equipped with a full complement of private amenities for the sake of visiting embassies and personnel." She looks pained. "Alas, the notion of 'privacy' has distinctly dissimilar implications by our reckoning and yours. To wit…" She indicates the white door ahead of us, next to the bathroom stalls. Apart from a vertical strip of light wood down the left side that houses the handle, the whole door is made of a sheer, foggy substance that lets light filter through, but gives only the faintest impression of what lies beyond. Atop the glass there's an abstract pastel painting of a rainstorm, a nude figure standing on a distant hill with her back turned and wringing out her hair.

All the ornamentation I've seen here is so incredibly out of place, something ostentatious in an otherwise austere facility. More than anything else, as different as the artistic style is, it still reminds me of the Zyahua manses, temples, and monasteries I visited in the course of my civilian career, back before we changed the world. It doesn't seem very "Society" to expend so much effort on something as trivial as marking a door. I would have expected something more like the slapdash semi-literate glyphs we used to label places of interest in the barracks, just… simpler. And smug somehow. Was the ornamentation Nishuin's idea? Hoping to make us feel comfortable and respected? 

The actual effect is incredibly intimidating, like at any moment a towering, fiery-tongued dowager is about to round the corner and scold me for not taking my sandals off.




"Bear, Jay, and me---" (can shower together)



"You look miserable," Bear observes.

I stare at my wine. The electronics in the room are still unplugged from Jay's visit. "I nearly pulled the trigger earlier," I whisper unsteadily.

*"Shit,"* Bear hisses. "Holy fuck, Kess."

"It would have been a *catastrophe.* I came way too close."

Bear suddenly gets a far-away look in his eyes. "You don't think…" he murmurs.

My blood runs cold as our eyes meet.

*"Fuck,"* I hiss.

"They couldn't have expected a raid to work," Bear says softly. "Maybe they cause a diplomatic incident, alright. But is that really worth showing their hand? They've been able to operate in the dark for *years*, without us even knowing they existed. That's gone now. Knowing how *den tsuang* intel works…"

I set my wine aside and walk to the window, staring out into the night. My hands are shaking.

"We have got to lock this down," I whisper. "Make absolutely certain the plan can't be triggered without my say-so or yours."

I see Bear's reflection nod. "Yeah. I agree. But with our codebooks taken…"

I take a deep breath. "We need to get a message to the principals. Tell them not to execute under any circumstances unless they get in-person confirmation."


"In the meantime," I add, "I think I need to tell the embassy about our codebooks."

*"What,"* Bear growls.

"They need to be destroyed. The only way that happens now is if the People do it for us. They're not going to let us get our hands on our things unless we back out and leave."

*"Kess--"*

"I know. But the codes are just one part. Without the authentication phrases they're useless."

"That was never more than a last-ditch failsafe," Bear retorts, "and it was never a very good one, Kess. The only thing protecting it is our will to hold out under torture. Exposing the books is *risky."*

"So is leaving the codes where they are. We still have our tripwire phrases if all else fails."

"Those pads will be in secure storage in a Society military base until we get back," Bear says placatingly. "Nobody knows those they even exist in the first place!"

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable betting on that anymore," I say distantly. "There was an entire Imperial black-ops ring headed by goddamn *den tsuang vó dua* operating in the dark in our territory this entire time and we didn't have the faintest clue until they *nearly destroyed us.* Either we get a message to the principals *immediately* and tell them the codes are compromised, or we physically destroy the codes. Ideally both. I am not comfortable making *assumptions* anymore, Bear."

Bear is silent for a moment. "Can we at least try the former first?"

I nod. "If I can get through to them quickly enough. Look, I'll talk to Jay first, get her input. She was black ops, apparently. If I get her go-ahead, we can sit down the three of us with Soshten and talk it out before we do anything."

"Soshten?" Bear raises an eyebrow. "That cute Green girl you're sleeping with?"

I can feel myself blushing. "God *dammit* how does everyone *know*--"

Bear chuckles quietly, stepping up behind me and putting an arm around my shoulder. Instinctively I lean against him. "You think I would let anyone get close to you without keeping an eye on them?"

"She can be trusted, I think. And if we go through with this, we're going to have to tell the Greens officially anyway. May as well start with the one I think will keep my secrets."

Bear sighs. "You remember that business with—"

*"I remember."* I gaze longingly toward my wine. "What is this, International "Humiliate Kestrel" Night or something?"

"I'm sorry, Kess," Bear says softly. "I don't mean to prod at old wounds. I'm just saying--"

"I know. Trust me, I will *never* forget what that bastard tried to pull."

Bear raises an eyebrow. "So how many state secrets have you told her already?"

I stare out into the night, cheeks burning. Bear sighs.

"It was an accident--" I blurt.

"I'm sure it was." Bear squeezes my shoulders. "But that's the whole problem. Kess, you're brilliant and you're a spectacular hardass when you need to be, but when you let your guard down you get soppy and emotional. And when that happens your tongue gets out ahead of your brain. There's a *reason* I try to steer you away from liquor in public."

"I thought you just took me for a lush."

"After what we've been through, I think we're all entitled to our vices," says Bear quietly. "I just don't want you getting yourself in trouble."

I laugh weakly. "That's what you're worried about? Not what I've done to our national security, but the possibility *I* might get in trouble?"

"I'm worried about our national security too. But that's a distant second. What did you tell her, anyway?"

I squeeze my wrist. "I may have… accidentally mentioned what really happened, um. To Cormorant."

Bear takes a deep breath. "Oh, Kess."

"I'm sorry."

He cracks a smile. "You say that like I'm *your* boss."

I look down. "I know. I'm sorry about that too."

"I'm always going to be on your side. You know that."

"I know. You've been taking care of me for years. You follow me around like Moose does Sparrow."

"Hey, now," Bear says lightly. "You've done the same for me."

I shake my head. "Not really. I try to stick up for you, I do--"

"That's putting it lightly," Bear rumbles, amused.

"--but you and I both know how one-sided this is. You've been covering for my weakness since the bad old days and I've only grown weaker with time."

"And I'll keep covering for you 'til it *kills* me," Bear answers matter-of-factly. "Someone has to, and I'd fight all contenders for the privilege." He punches me gently in the shoulder. "You're my *friend,* Kess. I care about you and I want to see you happy."

I slump against him. "I wish I was as strong as you," I murmur.

Bear strokes his beard thoughtfully. "I'm pretty sure that's a biological impossibility--"

I return the punch, weakly. "Shut up, that's not what I meant."

"You meant a different kind of strength, right?" Bear asks meaningfully. "Because, Kess, strength comes in all kinds of colors and sizes. I've never known a woman or a man more courageous than you. You have the kind of courage that lets you spit in the face of death, *and* the kind that lets you comfort a grieving mother. Sure, I can do things you can't. It's always been that way. And you can do things I can't. Like those aforementioned grieving mothers. What was it you always used to say? A commander has to be able to choose who lives and who dies?"

"Something like that," I murmur distantly.

"I've never felt right about how they bumped me up to Major," Bear says quietly. "Because you know I can't make those calls. I can't send boys I've trained and fought alongside off to die, not even if a thousand civilian lives are at stake. You *can*, and *you* don't do it by reducing them to numbers on a page. You make the hard calls without ever losing sight of the real people. There are more impressive things about you, I suppose, but that's always been the one I've been in solemn awe of. And I think it's the one that makes you *special.* You're the perfect balance between Cor and… well, Wagbeak."

"Is this why you wanted me to take the presidency so badly?" I ask softly.

Bear nods. "It is what it is. You say you can't do it, you're not the right woman, all right. I accept that. I know you must have your reasons. But Egret's problem has always been the way she… I don't know, abstracts away life and death."

"Numbers on a page."

"Yeah. And it's only gotten worse since the Evacuation. I know people like her have their uses, but you have to keep them on a tight leash. As it is, you're the only one holding Wagbeak's leash, and I suppose maybe that's for the best. You don't have to ruin yourself doing ugly, necessary things, but you can still stop her when she goes too far. But it's so tenuous, Kess. You're relying on such a fragile balance of power to keep her in check, when what we need is something systemic."

I retrieve my wine, draining the glass. "Do you think I was wrong?" I whisper almost unconsciously as I refill it.

Bear raises an eyebrow. "Beg pardon?"

"About the Khmai business," I tell him.

"With the nationalists?" Bear sounds surprised. I nod. "Spark within, Kess," he says, folding his arms. "That whole situation was a mess. I don't know *what* was the way to deal with it. It's one of those things where I don't think there is any good answer. "

"Earlier, I practically convinced myself the troops hate me so much… I thought Egret could have organized that attack and kept me from finding out."

"You think Wagbeak has more credibility with the military than you do," Bear says incredulously.

"Yeah. N-no. I don't know!" I throw back another mouthful of wine in frustration. Bear winces.

"That ain't whiskey, you know."

"Hush." I wipe my lips dry. 

##
-- Unaware that their plan has failed, Imperial Guard troops invade base to try and seize Kestrel & her staff as Soshten is trying to get them to a secure facility, forcing them to fight together

"Something's wrong," Soshten mutters, slowing her pace.

"What?" Jay demands, tensing.

"Comms just went down. I think— shit, someone's *jamming the internal net—"*

My body locks up mid-step.

Any lingering doubt over Egret's intentions, that traitorous little suspicion that this was all her plan from the start, evaporates like morning dew against the blast wave of a supernova.

Soshten shoves me into cover and sprints full force *towards* the Guardswoman. She's moving so fast all I see is a blur streak down the hallway. Then comes a loud, angry curse, a cry, and a second Guardswoman seems to materialize from around the corner, moving almost as fast as Soshten.

My heart is pounding in my ears.

At our best, with Sparrow, Bear, *and* Moose by my side, we would maybe just barely have a chance against *one* of those demons.

And Soshten just charged two of them all on her own.

Every instinct in my idiot brain is screaming at me to save her. Here I am, an unarmed, unprotected baseline who's been fighting with all her strength to let go of war forever, and still I feel driven to throw myself into battle for the sake of a far greater warrior.

*But I can't let them have her.*

Not again. *Never* again.

Only one thing to be done.

*I need you, God dammit.*

Something black and cold as the Void and red as fresh-spilt blood stirs in a long-barricaded corner of my soul.

*I need to be you again.*

The Ambassador closes her eyes, and the Commander opens them.

I smack my wristcon, searching frantically across the screen until I find the emergency function Soshten showed me, each moment painfully aware of my glacial slowness compared to the combatants down the hall. I press my forefinger against the blood-red text. It flares white, and the control screen vanishes, replaced with a battery bar and a countdown, the approximate amount of time left on its charge. As I move I can actually *feel* the added power behind my limbs. I could probably fracture a skull with a punch, if I didn't mind shattering my wrist in the process. Jay gazes at me quizzically, but there's *no time.*

"Go! Find security!" I tell her, pointing back the way we came -- anyone further down the hall is most likely dead already. Thank Shuharva, Jay doesn't argue, and sprints off without a word.

I glance at Bear. His jaw is set; expression determined. "Get out of here, Kess," he says softly. "I'll keep your Green girl alive."

"Like ash you will. Let's do this." Without another word, I break into a run toward the fight. Bear curses and bounds after me, shouting frantically for me to stop. But I know better than to leave him to his own devices when he's got that look in his eyes. I'll apologize later.

It takes me a few precious moments to get used to the new power available to my body. I barely keep my balance, each step practically a leap I could never have made with the strength of my limbs alone. It's dizzying, exhilarating -- and it's a struggle to stay realistic about my abilities, to keep the new power from going to my head. I feel a fool for not having practiced before an emergency struck.

Is this what it's like, to be *randani*?

Every moment I have in which to analyze the fight as I approach is more precious than sapphire. I know from experience I can't waste a single cycle of attention. One does not *fight* Guardswomen; one at best *survives* them, and only then with fantastic skill and luck on her side. When you're going up against someone who is faster *and* stronger than you could ever be, you dedicate your absolute all to staying clear of their blows or you die. The voidsheath is enhancing my strength at least threefold, but that won't make me any more durable. A single hit from a Guardswoman in her skivvies, let alone one in full plate, and I lose a limb or my life. Ironically, it's very much like fighting men -- albeit vastly more so.

"Fight" almost seems too small a word for what's going on at the other end of the corridor. The combatants are engaged in what can only be fairly described as a three-woman *battle.* They maneuver at a breakneck pace, all three throwing punches that hit louder than ricocheting bullets, but Soshten is moving like lightning, combining speed with a level of precision I wouldn't have thought physically possible. She's fending off blows from two full-kitted Guards simultaneously, a feat that so astounds me I almost don't notice she's losing.

*She's just trying to keep them occupied,* I realize, feeling sick. *She can't win this on her own.* By the way she immediately moved to close range, she must have been trying to force a mêlée -- a mind-bending prospect on its own. The best way to take out Guardswomen was always a headshot from a distance. Even those bitch-demons can't move fast enough to dodge rifle fire. Soshten only meant to buy us time to retreat, in exchange for her life.

Or worse.

Rage boils up in my heart.

*You will not have her.*

There is uncomfortably little cover to be found in the hallway, but the Guardswomen are so focused on Soshten they don't even seem to notice as I dash towards them. Rifles and sidearms are scattered on the floor around them; I don't bother going for one, having learned from painful experience that Guard weapons are locked to their armor. It takes an hour or so of work by a clever *tian bèi* to get them in a state where us mortals can fire them, and the ammunition is not easily come by.

We're still just two lowly baselines, compared to the godlike warriors tearing each other asunder not twenty paces away in a mêlée worthy of Shuharva himself. But we don't need to win. We just need to buy Soshten long enough to engage a Guard one-on-one.

"Remember Shadowed Gorge?" I ask Bear as he catches up, breathing hard.

"You're insane," he says conversationally. "We take the one on the right."

"Copy." We both break left at the last moment. Battle is all about asymmetries, and Guards are fully trained to take advantage of their own particular set. Even hardened soldiers make one fatal mistake fighting Guardswomen: they assume a Guard's only unnatural powers are the ones they can see.

That particular lesson has been scored hard and deep into our souls. Guards *feign* inattention. They hide the acuteness of their hearing. And you never find out how well they can multitrack their awareness until it's far too late.

Luckily for us, Guards are just as likely to underestimate *their* foes.

The woman on the right swings at thin air as Bear and I plow into the one on the left. Guards are strong, but Bear is two hundred _duan_ of finely-toned muscle and I'm moving fast enough that even my shoulder hits hard. The demoness topples, cursing as she hits the floor. Throwing all his weight and strength onto her elbow, Bear forces her left forearm to the ground, while I grab her right, straining with my enhanced strength to keep her pinned. My wristcon screams in alarm, battery bar dropping precipitously as the Guardswoman struggles. Together, we're able to hold her down for maybe a second and a half.

Fortunately, Soshten doesn't waste a fraction of that second. Before we even hit the ground I immediately hear the crack of a jawbone shattering and a strangled scream. I don't dare look away to follow the fight, but the sound tells me enough. It's exactly as I'd hoped: freed to focus on a single fighter, Soshten's edge in speed lets her thrash the bitch soundly.

The Guard beneath us wrenches her arm upward with enough force to send me flying. Old instincts kick in and I spin in the air, landing almost effortlessly on my feet. Newly freed from the pain of my damaged muscles, the maneuver actually feels *exhilarating* again, like Shuharva has granted me the briefest glimpse back into those glorious early days before the grim reality of war had the chance to infest our souls. 

Five paces away, the Guard is back on her feet as well, moving fast. She snaps into focus for a single heartstopping moment as she steadies herself for a skull-shattering blow, her other fist tight around Bear's throat. 

But the hit never comes. Instead, a quiet crack rings out from off to my right -- quiet enough that I actually hear the hideous *crunch* of bone as the magbolt impacts. The Guardswoman topples without a sound.

My plan worked.

"_Lahielto ce,_ Kess!" Soshi blurts, lowering her sidearm and rushing up to me. She hesitates, then turns and puts a few more rounds through the Guard's head before turning back to me and holstering the gun. Understandable.

I want so badly to stop being the Commander right now.

But if Shalvan isn't here when that happens, I'm scared I might actually slit my wrists again.

So I bury the Ambassador, and kneel down to rob a corpse.

"Kess?" Soshi asks, voice faltering, taking hold of my shoulder. Even through the metal and synth-leather of her dented combat gauntlets, the touch still manages to feel somehow intimate. "Are you alright?"

"No." I pull a holdout knife from the Guard's boot, and unbuckle the sheathe strapped below her waist. I slot the dagger into the sheathe and hold it to my leg, fastening the two straps tightly around my thigh. I slap the sheath, making sure it's secure, and rest my hand on the hilt of the blade. It feels good to have a weapon again. It feels horrible to have a weapon again, but that can wait.

I can have that meltdown when my friends' lives aren't hanging in the balance.

"That was incredible," Soshten says softly, caressing my lower back. "Insane, but incredible. I thought for certain you were dead when you came for that Guard."

"We had to get her off you." The sound of my own voice, so matter-of-fact, is offputting.

"I didn't know baselines even could fight like that."

"We can't." I turn this way and that, scanning the hallway. Bear's methodically expropriating the assets of the other corpse. "I put the voidsuit in emergency mode. Battery's nearly dead."

"That was smart," Soshten says. Smiling. Somehow, she's smiling.

And something about that smile stops me in my tracks, the cacophany of emotion inside my head going suddenly silent. And then she pulls me close, one armored hand around my waist, the other behind my neck. And she kisses me.

And right there in the hall, armored for battle and surrounded by death, it doesn't feel wrong. For one singular moment, my soul exults in a harmony I have never before known.

I loved Lily with all my heart. She was funny and clever. Good-natured, kind, brave, and adventurous as Shuharva's own son. But she was no warrior. She could never have understood that side of me. She was a silly, ladylike, pampered girl, a creature of luxury and base pleasures built for causing scandals at court. She drank up my war stories with wide eyes, but she was never *part* of them. And she was defenseless. I couldn't even manage to teach how to use a gun -- she'd scream and drop it the moment it kicked in her hands, no matter how many times I tried. She honestly seemed too *embarrassed* to hold the proper stance, like she had to make the posture somehow demure and alluring.

In a way, I held onto that. She was my totem, the emblem of everything I wanted life to have room for. As combat seared my soul, hers remained beautiful. Clean, unscarred, and pure.

And then the war came for her regardless.

For one golden moment, in the here and now, I actually *feel* like the person I was always supposed to be. Not the shattered soldier drowning her sorrows in gin and _şen_, nor the intrepid ambassador fleeing from her storied past, but the dashing action hero who never lost a battle and always knew just how to save the day.

"I've got your back," I whisper, staring into Soshten's eyes. Her smile broadens, and I see an actual tear in the corner of her eye. And I realize I'm smiling too. Somehow.

"And I've got yours," she says softly, squeezing the nape of my neck. Reluctantly, she turns away, taking me by the upper arm, and I don't resist her grip. It feels… right, somehow. Almost comforting. In fact, I find myself afraid that she'll let go. That that just might break the spell.

"I did warn you not to tempt fate," she comments.

I laugh softly. "I *will* remember next time."

"That went *way* better than Shadowed Gorge," Bear comments lightly as he saunters up, a pleased expression on his face, seemingly none the worse for wear for his latest brush with death. Bless the man.

Soshten tilts her head. "Shadowed Gorge?"

I heave a sigh.

"So, the way of it is," says Bear, "we have *real* strict rules of engagement for dealing with Guard. Ten-to-one advantage minimum, with arty or air superiority. Anything less calls for a retreat."

"There's not many ways to kill a *den tsuang vó dua,*" I mutter. "Throw a grenade at them and they'll just toss it right back at you, ten times out of ten. Unless you cook it so they can't get a grip on it before it blows, and trying *that* is a great way to blow up half your unit."

"But they can't dodge AP rounds," says Bear smugly, "and they seem to have a real hard time playing *pong shang* with artillery shells."

"The idea is, you run into Guard, you pin them down with suppressive fire, then call in artillery or an airstrike," I explain. "It's the only way we found to keep every battle from turning into a slaughter."

"That's the idea, alright," says Bear archly.

"Thing is… well, we have a saying—"

"'The battle plan is always the first casualty?'" asks Soshten. Apparently some maxims are universal.

"That's it exactly. Well, we were clearing a complex at the Gorge. Turned out a Guard bitch was running the place. It was just the one, but there weren't supposed to be *any* of the demons there. It was a Greycloak compound, House Bitterglint if I recall. We were picking through debris with handlamps when she charged us."

"And you… sat on her?" Soshten asks, raising an eyebrow. Bear laughs.

"Well, as luck would have it, her office had this beautiful balcony," I continue. "Stretched right out over the Gorge."

"…oh no." Soshten is clearly fighting to suppress a grin.

"So we empty our last mags backing her out onto the edge of the platform, and then Bear and Moose bum-rush her. Knocked her right off over the ledge. That gorge is *deep.*"

"Those safety rails were *not* up to code," Bear notes primly.

"You're telling me. We had to haul Moose back up onto the platform afterwards. I dislocated a shoulder. *Again.*"

I hear pounding feet and grip my knife, but I exhale in relief as a unit of armored Society soldiers turns the corner, a visibly exhausted Jay catching up half a minute later. She observes the scene with amazement, looking back and forth between the three of us.

"You killed them *both*," she breathes. "And you're all still *alive.*"

"Blame Soshten," I say, pointing a thumb in her direction as an armored medic rushes up to me. True to form, she starts unfastening my bodysheathe to look me over without even a word of warning.

*"Comrade!"* barks a flustered Jay, stalking up to the medic. "I'm going to have to ask you to *step away from the Ambassador*—"

I hold up a hand as the medic recoils in alarm. "Jay. Please. It's all right. She's just trying to help." I beckon to the medic, who hesitantly draws closer again. "They're not going to hurt me. I trust them."

"Forgive me, ma'am, but she was undressing you *right here in the hall*," Jay blurts angrily.

"It's just their way. It's fine, Jay, please. You did well; everyone is safe now."

"No thanks to me," Jay mutters, pursing her lips. "I wasn't fast enough to make a difference. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll do better next t--"

"Jay." I take her by the shoulder, startling her into silence. "You were just obeying orders." I wince as the medic pulls the suit down past my chest; my ribs already look horribly bruised. I didn't even *notice* taking a hit there. "I didn't really think you'd get back in time to make a difference. These fights move too fast. But it was worth sending someone as a contingency, and you made most sense. You're fast and you're sharp but you don't have the raw muscle mass to take on _vó dua_ in person. Everyone is alive, no one is seriously hurt, so stop beating yourself up." I raise a finger as she opens her mouth. "That was an order, Comrade Lieutenant," I tell her in my best no-nonsense voice. *Everyone is alive.*

Jay closes her mouth, reddening, and after a moment salutes sharply. She stalks off to examine the corpses.


"How did you manage react in time to change targets earlier?" Soshten asks, nodding towards the dead Guard. "That was amazing. I swear you started moving before I even noticed she was about to swing at you."

Bear and I glance at each other.

"You people haven't fought the *vó dua* in a while, have you," I ask slowly.

Soshten purses her lips. "There was the Vitian Affair… I think that was the last face-to-face clash with Guard. Wasn't much of a fight; we rolled over them with armor and air supremacy. That was about two hundred years ago, anyway."

Bear whistles.

"Yeah." I pat her on the shoulder. "I think we've got some things to teach you."


But I'm still unarmed.

I hastily pull on my gloves and turn on the magnav. Aiming my hand at a metal panel on the wall, I splay my fingers, and I'm rewarded with a gust of force that nearly topples me. It's not just the restrictors that are useful for combat.

I'm still just one lowly baseline, compared to the godlike warriors tearing each other asunder not twenty paces away.

But now Commander Kestrel has a weapon in her hands.

# chapter break

It takes me a few precious moments to get used to the new power available to my body. As I run down the hallway I barely keep my balance, each step practically a leap I could never have made with the strength of my limbs alone. It's dizzying, exhilarating. Is this what it's like, to be *randani*?

Fortunately, my guess as to the facility's layout proves correct. I find another connecting hallway and turn down it, sprinting towards the cacophony of combat. So far I've heard only a few gunshots, and those quiet -- both sides are apparently equipped with coilguns. By the way Soshten immediately moved to close range, she must have been trying to force a melee -- a mind-bending prospect on its own. The best way to take out Guardswomen was always a headshot from a distance. Even those bitch-demons can't move fast enough to dodge bullets.

There is uncomfortably little cover to be found in the hallway, but the Guardswomen are so focused on Soshten they don't even notice as I creep towards them. Rifles and sidearms are scattered on the floor around them; I don't bother going for one, having learned from painful experience that Guard weapons are locked to their armor. It takes an hour or so of work by a clever *tian bèi* to get them in a state where us mortals can fire them.

Instead, I watch -- pressed against the wall and making sure my terror shows, encouraging the Guardswomen to see me as a helpless bystander -- and wait for an opening. I'll have one chance, and one chance only, to influence the course of this fight.

"Fight" almost seems too small a word. The combatants are engaged in what can only be fairly described as a three-woman *battle.* They all move so quickly I can only 

What Nishuin said about perceptual acceleration isn't completely true. What I have is nothing compared to what the People can do, and it's not really under my control, but time has always seemed to slow when I rush into combat. "Battle high" we called it. Moose had it too; for Bear it only came on when things got seriously bad. Maybe it has something to do with that "adrenaline" Nishuin mentioned. A drug the body makes for itself? The baseline-grade PX is hardly enough to take a Guardswoman head on, but it does just barely let me see her blows coming. Ordinarily that wouldn't be worth much, since accelerated reactions or not, my muscles just don't have the power behind them to move at the clip I'd need to dodge. I'm gambling that the voidskin will give me just enough extra power to pull it off.

My moment comes. A guardswoman manages to get behind Soshten, drawing her sidearm. Moments before she can apply a two-handed grip, I hurl myself at her, throwing out a hand and activating the mag-pulse.

Her wrist jerks, and the weapon flies free, clattering against a wall and dropping to the ground. For a moment she freezes in confusion, then blurs, spinning, coming into focus facing me. My audacity buys me a single moment -- her sheer incredulity at her hapless baseline target charging her like a hatchling *phin hue* charging a frenzied *guan jèi*.

Her face is the only part of her body that isn't thoroughly armored, so it's where I aim. I'm able to get a single blow in before she reacts, and I smirk with satisfaction at the crunch of cartilage as her nose breaks under my fist. The pain that flashes up my arm is ruinous, but so very worth it.

Her blow comes immediately and I just barely dodge it. Her face is twisted, almost bestial. I've pissed her off, alright.

Now I just need to keep her attention.

"The target!" she roars, her hateful Core accent sending shivers down my spine. "Ignore the *den dzèin*, she is a distraction!"

The other Guardswoman promptly tries to disengage, but Soshten is having none of it. One thing is clear -- as fast as the Guardswomen are, little Soshten has an overwhelming speed and reaction advantage. Even coordinating their strikes the women have trouble landing a single blow. If it was just one Guard, I actually find myself able to believe Soshten could have ended this quickly.

But there are two. And despite her earlier boasting, the poor girl seems caught in a stalemate.

I know from experience I can't waste a single cycle of attention analyzing the battle. One does not *fight* Guardswomen; one at best *survives* them, and only then with fantastic skill and luck on her side. When you're going up against someone who is faster and stronger than you could ever be, you dedicate your absolute all to staying clear of their blows or you die. The voidskin is enhancing my strength at least threefold, but that won't make me any more durable. A single hit from a Guardswoman, even unarmored, and I lose a limb or my life. Ironically, it's very much like fighting men -- albeit vastly more so.

So from that point on I'm on the defensive, as I fully expected. Without the voidskin I'd be dead a dozen times over in the first ten seconds; with it, I can keep just barely ahead of the creature's fists. After a few more fruitless swings, her attention wavers for a moment and she goes for a knife. Just as it leaves its sheathe, I throw up both hands and *push.*

I time the mag-pulse simultaneously with the highest jump I can manage. The knife is ripped from her hand and I'm hurled away from her backwards down the hallway as the Guardswoman stumbles and curses. Old instincts kick in and I spin in the air, landing almost effortlessly on my feet. By the time I've turned back around the Guard has almost caught up with me.

I get one more pulse out of the suit before a sharp crack of pain shoots up my arm. The battery was already almost fully charged when I left my quarters. This suit was clearly never intended for the kind of shit I'm pulling. I should be glad my insane idea didn't just fry the thing. Still, I can't help but be disappointed by how quickly I burned through its power. I was hoping it would at least last a few minutes.

No more magpulses. I need to save every last drop of power for the artificial muscles; they're the only thing keeping me alive.

As I back away, ducking and dodging and feinting frenetically, a cold, clammy dread creeps over me. I'm losing this fight. Slowly, yes, but am I losing slowly enough?

The Guard snaps into focus for a moment as she steadies herself for a powerful blow, and I reflexively throw myself backwards, but the hit never comes. Instead, a quiet crack rings out from down the hall -- quiet enough that I actually hear the hideous *crunch* of bone as the magbolt impacts. The Guardswoman topples without a sound.

My plan worked.

"_Ielecto co lahiente,_ Kess!" Soshi blurts, lowering her sidearm and rushing up to me. She hesitates, turns, and puts a few more rounds through the Guard's head before turning back to me. Understandable.

I want so badly to stop being the Commander right now.

But if Shalvan isn't here when that happens, I'm scared I might actually slit my wrists again.

So I bury the Ambassador, and kneel down to rob a corpse.

"Kess?" Soshi asks, voice faltering, taking hold of my shoulder. Even through the metal and synth-leather of her combat gauntlets, the touch still manages to feel somehow intimate. "Are you alright?"

"No." I pull a backup knife from the Guard's boot, and unbuckle the sheathe strapped below her waist. I slot the dagger into the sheathe and hold it to my leg, fastening the two straps tightly around my thigh. I slap the sheathe, making sure it's secure, and rest my hand on the hilt of the blade. It feels good to have some kind of weapon again. It feels horrible to have a weapon again, but that can wait.

I can have that meltdown when my friends' lives aren't hanging in the balance.

"That was incredible," Soshten says softly, stroking my lower back. "Insane, but incredible. I thought for certain you were dead when you came after that Guard."

"I had to get her off you." The sound of my own voice, so matter-of-fact, is offputting.

"I didn't know baselines even could fight like that."

"We can't." I turn this way and that, scanning the hallway. "I cranked up the voidskin servos. Battery's nearly dead."

"That was clever," Soshten says. Smiling. Somehow, she's smiling.

And something about that smile stops me in my tracks, the cacophany of emotion inside my head going suddenly silent. And then she pulls me close, one armored hand around my waist, the other behind my neck. And she kisses me.

And right there in the hall, armored for battle and surrounded by death, it doesn't feel wrong. For one singular moment, my soul exults in a harmony I have never before known.

I loved Lily with all my heart. She was funny and clever. Good-natured, kind, brave, and adventurous as Shuharva's own son. But she was no warrior. She could never have understood that side of me. She was a silly, ladylike, pampered girl, a creature of luxury and base pleasures built for causing scandals at court. She drank up my war stories with wild eyes, but she was never *part* of them. And she was defenseless. I couldn't even manage to teach how to use a gun -- she'd scream and drop it the moment it kicked in her hands, no matter how many times I tried. She honestly seemed too *embarrassed* to hold the proper stance.

In that one moment, I actually *feel* like the person I was always supposed to be. Not the shattered soldier drowning her sorrows in gin and _şen_, nor the intrepid ambassador fleeing from her storied past, but the dashing action hero who never lost a battle and always knew just how to save the day.

"I've got your back," I whisper, staring into Soshten's eyes. Her smile broadens, and I see an actual tear in the corner of her eye. And I realize I'm smiling too. Somehow.

"And I've got yours," she says softly, squeezing the back of my neck. Reluctantly, she turns away, taking me by the upper arm, and I don't resist her firm grip. It feels… right, somehow. Almost comforting. In fact, I find myself afraid that she'll let go. That that just might break the spell.

"I did warn you not to tempt fate," she comments as we hurry away.

I laugh softly. "I *will* remember next time."

##

The soldier gives me a sullen glance as I step inside the cold, dark, imposing stone room. He follows it with another glance, eyes widening, and then he springs to his feet, standing to attention as best his restraints will allow. "Comman— General!" he blurts, awestruck, voice brimming with disbelief and joy.

I've never seen this man before in my life, but he recognizes me instantly, despite my best efforts, and apparently reveres me. I'm never going to get used to being the postergirl for Wagbeak's planetary propaganda grid.

As I come to a halt, I look him up and down. "Soldier, where in the Star-Mother's *sanctum* is your shirt?"

He reddens. "I— I apologize, ma'am," he stutters. "They haven't given it back since…"

It's clear enough what's been done to him. I grit my teeth. There's a chair for an interrogator to sit in, but I remain standing for the moment, arms folded, greatcoat flapping about my heels. I changed out my bloody old army drabs for a custom-made coat of sleek black leather not long after the Gala; Wagbeak immediately complained that it made me look less like a war hero and more like one of the Empress' inquisitors. That felt appropriate, after a fashion. Irritating her usually does.

"For the record," I tell him drily, "I find B.C. the more flattering of the titles. It is the one I *earned,* after all."

He smiles, an odd expression on a half-naked man with that many bruises and wounds. "Understood, commander! Thank Shuharva you've come, ma'am. I was beginning to think I was done for—"

I take a seat across from him, leaning forward. "Tell me what happened."

He falters. "You… don't know?"

"I've heard the President's account. And your girl's, though she was a bit too distraught to make sense."

"Primrose!" He sits up sharply. "Is she—"

"She's frightened half to death, but unharmed," I tell him gently. "Lucky for you she knew what to do. Even if it took half a pint of strong drink to calm her down when she showed up at my offices." I look down. "I left one of my brothers in arms to take care of her. Someone… personally loyal to me. Just… in case."

He breathes out, a look of utter relief on his face. *"Thank you,* Commander," he whispers. "I know I shouldn't worry about things like that, not in this day and age, but, well… after what happened…" He pauses, apparently finally processing the fact that I *do* worry about things like that, and suddenly looks deeply frightened.

Looking at that expression, I feel so weary.

"What happened at the border, lieutenant?" I ask him softly.

He draws in a deep breath. "Well, ma'am, it's like this. Er — do you follow the situation thereabouts, ma'am? I know you must be terrible busy—"

Not nearly busy enough.

No matter how fast you run and how hard you fight you just can't save everyone.

And at the end of the day you're always left to face your nightmares alone.

"I try to keep up," I say. "But there's enough discrepancies 'twixt the papers and the official reports I get that I know better'n to trust either."

He looks at me quietly for a moment. "May I speak freely, ma'am?" he asks slowly, and there's an *undercurrent* in his voice now. Yeah. Kid's no amateur. Ash, he's probably a Blue Stripe, which means *they took his damn stone from him*.

It wouldn't *matter* if he *were* a crook and traitor. If he's earned his honors, they're his to the pyre. It ought to be law, and if it isn't, I'll fucking well *see* it so.

I purse my lips, watching the security cameras overhead for any untoward sign of motion. "I instructed the President that this was to be a private interview," I said quietly. "She may well be listening in anyway, but if anyone catches her at it, *she will be in trouble,*" I continue, raising my voice for the last part and glaring towards the security cameras.

He nods. "I understand, ma'am. S'pose that's the best I have any right to hope for." He sits back. "Border protests ain't uncommon. As it was, *we* basically drew down the borders for the region, a sight carelessly so. That line cut right through whole communities, communities that took up arms together against the *den tsuang*. I'm sure some of them fought alongside our boys. And suddenly we're putting up roadblocks, saying you can't go here and there without passbooks and permission, you can't come in without a valid reason and a visa—"

I nod. "Unhappy mess, ain't it."

"Yeah. Well, the Nationalists aren't thugs, whatever anyone might have you think. Their protests have always been peaceful. But they're loud. They're clever. They have state backing. Makes me feel right like Matikhe-bepissed *dirt* standing there on the line 'twixt families as got cut in half for no damn reason at all, I don't mind saying, so I can only imagine what kind of a humiliation it is for the central government."

His accent is familiar, I realize slowly. He might actually be from my home district, or at least somewhere in the city. His Zia Ţai is plainly that of a native speaker, which fits. Khmai back home weren't really any different from ordinary folk, not like you'll find in some cities. We didn't even have a Khmai Quarter. Folk just mixed.

"They describe the protestors as rabble-rousers. Violent, disruptive."

He shakes his head. "Ain't so, ma'am, if you'll pardon my say-so. No one crossed the line. No one tried to. They just stood there, close as they could get. They made us see their hurt."

"So how did the violence start, in your estimation?"

He closes his eyes. "We got an order, or so we were told," he says distantly. "From the Provincial Command. We were to… break up the protest." His face twists. "I don't know what the order said precisely. Khata'e's tits, I don't know for certain there *was* an order. I just know the commander came from the telegraph office and said we were under orders. To shoot into the crowd."

My blood runs cold.

"They were unarmed?"

He hesitates. "Some of them had pitchforks, spades. A couple had dueling swords or rifles. And of course, their border guard wasn't exactly eager to be helping us out. But," he adds quickly, "they never drew on us. They came prepared to defend themselves, not to attack. I'd swear it on my life and on the Star-Mother's own honor, ma'am."

I nod. "So what happened?"

He sighs. "Most of the boys were real hesitant. But a couple were just looking for an excuse to start blasting away. I'm sure you know the type; they can't handle shame. They turn it outwards and throw it at whoever is making them feel guilty, like animals lashing out. So it started, and then everyone would have followed suit eventually. Orders is orders; this ain't Topaz. Lot of people would have died. People as hadn't done naught wrong. Women, children, old folk. Folks as just wanted to be with their families. Family, you know, that *means* something to a Khmai—"

I nod. "*S'jushta je,*" I say gently. *I understand.*

"They would have done it," he responds quietly. "Ma'am, it coulda started a war—"

A chill trails down my spine. *What if that was exactly the point…*

"So you intervened."

"I drew on Unit Commander Witherfrond." He looks down, having a hard time meeting my eyes. "Ma'am, I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt, I thought— *va Mati*, I had to stop it somehow. So many people were about to die—"

"But he didn't back down, did he?"

"My own comrades were pointing guns at me. Commander didn't fucking *flinch.* Thought I was bluffing. Told the men to fire anyway. I said I'd kill him if they did. He just repeated the order." His fists clench. "The shooting started. I was so angry, so panicked, so desperate—"

"You killed him."

He nods, shamefaced. "Yes, ma'am. I didn't see what happened next. Coupla boys piled on me, dragged me off. I heard gunfire, screams. I swear I never meant for… I was trying to *stop* all that."

I tap my fingers on the table. I shouldn't feel so *cold* inside hearing about my own men being gunned down, but it's like my whole spirit is so far into a complicated maneuver that it can't spare the troops to man its own empathy stations on such sudden notice. "But you said you *didn't* see what happened."

"Interrogators told me, after a few days, ma'am."

"What precisely did they tell you?"

He looks up suddenly, frowning. When he speaks, his voice isn't quite so wretched; he seems to realize what I'm getting at. "Well, ma'am — they said it was a bloodbath. That my unit couldn't fight back effectively with their officers down. Everyone was wiped out."

"That was a lie," I respond bluntly. He actually gasps with relief.

"Oh, *thank Shuharva,*" he breathes raggedly, sitting back and shaking his head.

"Did they even bother to say anything about the protesters?"

"Not much, ma'am. Just that they killed us all— something about an organized assault into the town—" He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, ma'am. I was in a lot of pain — my memory ain't so clear."

My gaze returns briefly to his scars. I scowl.

"If I may, ma'am," the lieutenant asks hesitantly — "what did happen, in truth?"

"Well, I wasn't there," I say distantly, forcing myself to focus on the man's face, burying away anger that won't do me any good in the moment. "But I did get my hands on the photomimeses the investigators and cleanup crews took. I interviewed a few other witnesses, and I apparently have enough clout with the Nationalists I was able to get a short phone call with one of their border guards."

He cracks a smile. "I imagine they'd be falling over themselves to please *you,* ma'am."

I rub my forehead. "I had to wade through four levels of effusive elders and I was invited to six different banquets before I managed to arrange an interview," I mutter. "I suppose I'll have to attend at least one of their parties to make up for this disaster. " I clasp my hands. "Near as I can make out, this is what happened.

"There was a bloodbath. That much is true. However, it was not to the extent you were led to believe. Without leadership, your unit fragmented. A number of soldiers did fire into the group of prostesters. They were armed with automatic weapons and there were many injuries and deaths. Some of your soldiers attempted to reason with the attackers. Some of the protesters ran. Others, mostly young men, swarmed the attacking soldiers to try and save their people. The Khmai border guards began returning fire. They were armed with rifles, but they only targeted the men who were shooting. The attackers were all killed, one by a shot in the back while attempting to flee. Accounts differ as to who killed her; no one seems to want to take responsibility. I don't personally care.

"The border guard I spoke to on the Nationalist side said some of your men joined hers in gunning down the attackers. She didn't know your name, but she spoke well of you. Asked me to pass on her thanks." I shake my head. "The poor girl was shattered, lieutenant. I don't think she'd ever taken a life before."

"Her people will take care of her. She will be honored for a hero, I promise you that."

I fix my gaze on him. *"Your* people."

He winces. "Yeah. There was some trouble about that."

"If I am to believe what the President told me," I say, lighting a cigarette, "you are a traitor, a sympathizer or a Khmai Nationalist yourself, who started a massacre out of misplaced rage and ethnic chauvinism. " I inhale deeply, blowing smoke towards a security camera, *daring* it to twitch under my gaze.

"Khata'e's breath, no!" The lieutenant's eyes are wide, his voice pleading. "Our people aren't *like* that. Commander, you have to believe me, the Khmai love our neighbors. A-as long as they're not Kaparttu. But we don't *murder* people. I admit it, I care about my race. That doesn't mean I hate yours!"

I nod. "I don't like this picture she's trying to paint of the Nationalists," I say quietly in trench Khmaira. "Nobody likes a chauvinist. Especially not a Zyahua. Worse, Silverdawn is half-Khmai herself, which gives her unearned credibility among the Khmai populace of our territories." I pause. "I'm sorry, lieutenant. I'm thinking out loud." I flick ash from the end of the cigarette. "A bad habit of mine. This is irrelevant to you."

"No, no," he exclaims urgently. "Please, commander -- if you have to leave me to rot to solve this mess, do it. I was ready to give my life to stop a war. I still am." His voice is quivering now. "Matikhe alive -- I don't want to see our people shedding each others' blood. Not after everything we did together. *For* each other! It would be as brothers slaying brothers. Anything is better than that. Use my name, scapegoat me, I don't *care* -- just do what has to be done." There's a finality in his words now. "I'll play along, you have my word; just give me my marching orders."

I fix my gaze on him. His story matches everyone else's. It has that raw quality to it words often do when they're spoken from the heart. And I just can't make myself believe that I'm looking at a dishonorable man. His eyes, his voice — he seems so vulnerable and open.

And it's hard to keep together a consistent lie when you've just been tortured as badly as this poor soldier has.

I lean forward. "I will be *flayed alive* before I throw one of my own damn men to the wolves for a bit of convenience. 'Sides which, I can hardly imagine a scenario where blaming you *doesn't* make things worse."

He pauses, then nods. "You're right, I suppose, ma'am." He looks down. "I should be relieved, but I feel bloody useless right now, ma'am."

I heft the pack of cigarettes. "You smoke?"

He nods. "Swear to Shuharva, the shit kept me alive in the trenches." He cracks a grin. "I'd feel disloyal stopping now, y'know?"

I pass him a smoke, snapping open my lighter and holding it out as he holds the cigarette awkwardly to his lips with a cuffed hand. He inhales deeply, then leans back, breathing out and closing his eyes. "Thank you, ma'am," he murmurs from one side of his mouth, voice softening. "My nerves have been a raw wire for days."

"I suspect I know only too well," I say softly. He nods solemnly. I tuck the smokes back into my coat, in the special pocket next to the holster where my sidearm is concealed. "These are Empire-grown. Got 'em off a greycloak, I think. I had a little stash I kept during the war of the smokes I nicked off corpses or outta noble mansions." I pat the pocket fondly. "This'll be the last of those."

"Ma'am!" the lieutenant exclaims, eyes widening. "You shouldn't have."

I wave him away. "I kept 'em for rough days. Ain't no one been able to take a knife to *my* breast in years now, though I'm sure there's a few would relish having me on the other side of this table. Anyway, our growers will figure out the secret sauce soon enough." I hesitate. "I hope," I add piously.

"Thank you, all the same."

"Don't mention it." I pause. "Actually, do. It'll make Silverdawn fume."

He snickers. "Aye-aye, commander."

I stand, stifling a wince at the pain from my ruined back. "I'm going to clean this up," I tell him. "Way I figure it, there was never going to be a good outcome that day. Whoever sent your commander those orders—" and I have an ugly suspicion just who that was "—saw it sealed. But if you hadn't stepped in, I don't doubt many more innocents would have lost their lives."

"I did frag my CO," he says grimly. "Law doesn't leave a lot of room for interpretation on that account."

I shrug. "Law's meant to be inflexible. That was always the idea. It's a waste to try to predict all the exceptions that might come up; you just create loopholes the ill-intentioned can take advantage of, and make the laws so complex ordinary folk can't make sense of the whole wretched morass. You ever done counter-insurgency in a village?" He shakes his head. "Well, it's like this. You sweep through with battle taxies kitted out for prisoner transport, get everyone secure in cuffs, and then you have all the time you need to sort out the civilians from the combatants who might be hiding among them. You don't risk your men's lives having 'em turn their backs on possible enemies, and you don't gun down possible innocents. It's the same with the law. We can't risk false negatives. But a false positive, a case where following the law strictly gives an unjust result? The Senate is sovereign for a reason, son. It was meant to be the 'supreme organ of the people's power.'" Cormorant's phrase. "It can do what it likes, whether that's change the law outright, make exceptions to it — or put away people who figured out how to do wrong without falling afoul of the letter of the law."

"You're… going to take my case to the *Senate?*" He looks a little scared now.

"Only if I have to," I tell him. "I can probably bully Silverdawn into letting this all drop, since she's apparently been *lying to my face* again. She knows I can drag witnesses in front of the Senate and humiliate her if she presses the issue, and she won't chance that. Her image is, unfortunately, the only thing holding this country together right now." I gaze down the hallway towards the exit, where Silverdawn's justiciars are waiting. "She's a snake, but she won't risk the Republic. Not for anything."

He frowns. "I can't figure her out, ma'am."

"You know, the Ninth, we had a code. *No comrade left behind."* I sigh deeply. "Not even if it meant risking the whole op. The whole damn *war.* And in the end one of my best men gunned himself down with his radio open, so's to make *sure* we didn't try and rescue him from the *den tsuang* and get ourselves all killed."

"Shuharva's blade," breathes the soldier, eyes wide. "Commander — I'm so sorry."

I shrug. "War ain't a pleasant affair. Point is, Silverdawn — she has her code as well. She won't let this Republic fall, not for anything in the worlds." I fix my gaze on him, looking him in the eye. "*Anything,*" I repeat forcefully. He gives me a nod of understanding.

"Don't hate her for what she's done, if you can manage," I say quietly, turning away. "I'll secure you a personal apology." I pause by the doorway, turning back. "How long did they torture you?" I ask him, again meeting his gaze.

He flinches, looking away. "I'm not really sure," he says quietly. "It's all a haze. Minutes feel like hours when you're hurting that hard."

I nod. It was a stupid question, anyway. "Is the damage likely to be crippling?"

"No, ma'am," he says quickly. "Our interrogators are no blackrobes. The wounds are mostly superficial. Cuts and burns will heal. Give me a week and I'll be fit for duty again, you have my word."

I nod again, relieved. "I can probably swing you Black Stripe accomodations in the Inner Circle. For yourself and your lady. Will that be enough?"

"Wh-what?" he stutters, shocked. "'Enough?' For— for what?"

"Compensation," I answer. "They tortured a veteran of the War because he told a truth they didn't want to hear. I'm not going to let that go."

"It's alright, ma'am, really," he says gently. "No harm done. Just a bruised ego. People like the President, well — she was of the Blood in all but name. You live that kind of soft life, you don't actually understand what it is you're doing when you have someone put to the sparker."

"No," I say quietly. "She understands *intimately* what she did to you." I stub out my cigarette and flick it towards a biohazard bin with bloodied tissues poking out from the top. "I'll get you that luxury apartment. You need anything else, you just give me the word."

I leave the speechless soldier sitting with a cigarette between his fingers, and as I step out the door, I stop holding back my anger.

"Silverdawn will see me now," I tell the nearest ISB goon without bothering to look at her.

The mousey woman clears her throat. "I am… sorry, General, but the President—"

I turn to the woman, idly unbuckling my jacket, my eyes boring into hers as I step closer, into her personal space. "Were you the one who cut on that man?" I ask her conversationally as I reach for my smokes. Her eyes fix on the handgun as my hand moves towards it, and she pales.

That's right, darling. I really *could* shoot you where you stand and walk out of here a free woman.

Evidently drawing the same conclusion, the woman clears her throat. "I'll… take you to her. Ma'am."

I don't bother to let the guards announce me this time, throwing open the doors to Silverdawn's office myself and striding in, hands in my pockets, smoke curling from my lips. Wagbeak looks up tiredly from her desk, pen twitching in her fingers. It's always odd seeing someone of her upbringing doing her own writing.

"Are you satisfied now?" she asks, face expressionless.

I stop a foot from her desk. "Out," I say, raising my voice and snapping my fingers. "You will shut the door behind you and remain there until I have instructed you otherwise."

"Ma'am," says the ISB woman, exasperated, "you do not have the authority—"

I turn on my heel and draw on her, sidearm aimed just clear of her flank.

"Peregrine," says Egret, her voice strained. "Give us a moment."

"Ma'am," Peregrine croaks, "the woman is plainly homicidal—"

"Question my orders to my face *once* more and you will spend the rest of your life mucking out stables on a collective farm," Egret growls. Peregrine backs away, and leaves without a second word. I reholster the gun. Wagbeak looks me in the eye. "Honestly, Kestrel, what has gotten into you lately? I understand you enjoy spiting me but are you really going to get yourself *killed* just to—"

Her sentence ends in a squeak of alarm as she finds her chest pressed flat against her desk, my right hand on her back — not so gentle this time — and my left gripping hers in a wristlock. I give her arm a twist and she lets out a cry of pain.

"What the *fuck,* Egret," I hiss.

I look up sharply as a door opens on the far side of the room. On the other side is a young Khmai woman in a short, tight-fitting silky black dress, a silver cardigan hanging loosely over her arms. Hair as white as snow cascades down her shoulders. Her feet are bare on the rich carpet. She looks between us with a concerned expression.

"Hey, Kess," she says awkwardly, glancing questioningly at Egret.

"Daisy. Darling girl," Egret manages. "Would you give the General and I a moment of privacy, dear?"

Daisy looks back to me. There's no fear in her eyes, and she doesn't stand with the flighty posture you'd expect from an unarmed waif kitted out for office politics and candlelit dinners, not hand-to-hand combat. She stuffs her hands in the handwarmers of her cardigan as she approaches — slowly, but not hesitantly.

"What's going on, Kess?" she asks, her voice pleading. "This has been a rough day for all of us."

"Some more than others." I glare at Egret. "How much did she tell you?"

"Daisy. Please—"

"What about?" She pops up and down on her heels, scrutinizing me with that intelligent, inquisitive gaze of hers.

"The slaughter at the border."

Daisy sighs. "I've been handling that mess all day. My brothers down south are up in arms. They say *we* did this, we provoked this. I'm trying to get the truth through—"

"She is trying, as am I, to stop a *war,*" Egret grunts. "Kestrel, if you would be *civilized* for a moment—"

I twist her arm again and she breaks off with a cry. Daisy gives me an unhappy look.

"Kess," she says, voice wounded. "What was that *for?"*

"Where in *Haven* do I start?" I growl. "Wagbeak has been lying to you, Daze. And apparently, the *world.*"

"What," says Daisy softly.

"Where is this ridiculous accusation coming from?" Egret demands, wiping tears from her eyes with her free hand. "Kestrel, don't tell me you fell for the nonsense that traitor has been *regurgitating*—"

"You know, the funny thing, *Egret,"* I snap. "I get briefings. As befits a general of my station, I suppose. I've had my people focusing on, y'know, the possibility another Godforsaken *war* might break out with our fucking *sisters in arms,* and they gave me just enough juicy little tidbits of embarassing intel that I could honestly believe I was getting the full story, rather than the same propaganda you feed to the papers." I lean closer, ignoring the hateful twinge in my lower back. "It was *so* calculated I knew from the start you had something you didn't want me to find. So I did my own digging. Using people *I* trust, not a gaggle of appointed sycophants my chief of staff practically has to *beat* useful information out of."

Egret groans.

"I find it hard to believe, Egret, that in one day of making phone calls and studying mimesis sheets, I could have figured out something that the *entire ISB* somehow got wrong. They may be thugs but you wouldn't put up with them if they were *dumb* ones."

"Kestrel?" Daisy asks softly, eyebrows furrowing.

"This is your own damn fault, you know!" Egret howls, voice breaking a bit with emotion. "I could have avoided this if you'd just let me—!"

"Who gave the order?" I snap.

"Order?" Egret hisses. "What order—"

"The order to gun down a bunch of innocent Khmai who just wanted to see their families again," I growl.

*"What,"* whispers Daisy.

"There was no order!" Egret exclaims. "Kestrel, God, I know we have our differences, but do you honestly believe I'd have innocent Khmai gunned down for no damn reason?"

"No," I say quietly. "I think you'd do literally anything for one very particular reason."

She's quiet for a moment. Then she shakes her head slowly. "There are some things I could not do."

"Really? You'd let the Cormorant's dream die for the sake of something as trivial as your honor?"

"Kestrel!" Daisy exclaims. "That's cruel. Please don't be like this."

"Cruel. Interesting choice of word, Daze." My eyes remain fixed on Silverdawn. "Do you know what she's had her pet justiciars *doing* to that poor man these past few days?"

"Interrogating him, I assume?"

"Torturing him," I growl, "because he wouldn't give them the answers she wanted."


"Do you know the worst thing, Egret?" I ask, turning away. "The worst thing is I can't write this off as some sheltered idiot noble ruining lives and bodies as she flails about, incapable of knowing better." I take one last draw from my dying cigarette, the cooling touch of the şen recoiling from the tight, burning knot of anger in my soul like tapwater from a floe of lava. "You know exactly what you've done to that man."

"Yes," she says quietly. I close my eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath of clean air, then turn on my heel and knock her to the floor with a full-force punch to the gut.

Daisy's eyes widen and she puts her hands to her mouth, but she doesn't move or cry out. Egret groans quietly on the floor, clutching her stomach. Her brow is bleeding where it caught the edge of her desk. I toss the smoldering cig into her overflowing ashtray as the ISB bursts into the room, guns raised.

"Hands on your head!" Peregrine bellows. "Hands on your fucking head, you *lunatic!* Get away from the President—"

She falters. Egret, with difficulty, is clambering unsteadily to her feet, and as she does, she steps between me and the furious agent.

"If you so much as injure this woman," Egret says, voice betraying only exhaustion, "I won't bother waiting for the courts or the Senate. I will put a bullet in your head myself. And I hope you understand, Peregrine, *what a mercy that would be.*" She clasps her hands behind her back, suddenly regal and radiant in her brilliant white gown, and in the voice of a weary queen she commands, "*Leave us.*"

Peregrine's mouth drops open and works for a moment, plainly trying to figure out *something* to say that will keep her boss alive without costing her her cushy job, before eventually giving up and motioning Egret's bodyguards to follow her out of the room. All glare at me as they leave. I barely spare them a glance.

Daisy returns from the other room carrying an emergency medical kit and a warm wet cloth. She busies herself cleaning and bandaging the gouge above Egret's eyebrow. Egret sits silently on her desk as Daisy works, giving no further sign of pain.

"Do you understand what it would do to this planet if you died?" Egret asks me at length, gazing up to me. Before I can answer, she continues, "do you have any idea what it would do to *me?*" She beckons to Daisy. "Whiskey."

"Yes, ma'am." Daisy disappears into a side room. Egret's gazes fixes on me.

"So few of us are still left alive," Egret says, so quietly I barely hear her. "You. Me. Bear. *None* of the people who worked with her before it all began, do you realize that? I am the only one." She looks away, and I realize her hands are shaking. "Passerine was taken apart by the justiciars. Cinderbloom was poisoned, I never did manage to finger the culprit. Finch was shot while we were evacuating Swallow's Perch and Hope gave up her seat on the last train out so a wounded soldier wouldn't have to leave her lover behind to torture and death. Even Lion, and he was there the night she—" She stops abruptly, pressing a hand violently against her bruised stomach.

I gaze levelly at the President. It really shouldn't surprise me, after all these years, that she still remembers all their names.

And how they died.

"I don't really fault you, Kestrel," Egret says gently. "Your actions are not entirely your own. You do well enough to hide it from the others — and I thank you for showing them that kindness — but it is obvious to me your mind is broken."

My heart, which has been perfectly calm up until this very moment, starts pounding frantically in my ears.

"And still you strain yourself. I suppose I should *expect* you to go off like a damaged handgun, at this point."

"Egret," I hiss. "Stop."

She regards me thoughtfully. "You so rarely call me that these days. —Thank you, dear." She takes the proferred whiskey from Daisy.

"Is it true, ma'am?" asks Daisy, folding her arms.

"Yes," Egret says flatly. "I lied to you."

Daisy lets out a hiss. "Why!?"

"Because," Egret says tiredly, "you are too burdened by your youthful sense of morals. We needed a scapegoat, dear. We needed someone we could hand over to the Nationalists on a silver platter with a signed confession, and say, here is the reason your people are dead. If it was one of their own, so much the better! That would perhaps be sufficiently embarassing to make them back off and stop causing trouble for a while."

"A scapegoat?" I breathe, trying to keep myself from strangling the woman here on the spot. "You're the reason this whole mess happened; if you hadn't sent that damn order—"

"I did not send an order," Egret snaps. "Kestrel. *Think,* for a moment, if your ruined brain is still capable of reason. Why, in the name of *God on Khata'e's bosom* would I order innocents slain, but then sacrifice one of my own soldiers to *prevent* a war?"

"Maybe because he had the guts to stand up to you. We can't have that, can we?"

She gives me a look of utter exhaustion. "Yes. *I'm* the villain here, for putting a murderer to good use keeping the very peace you are *so* irrationally eager to protect. What do you even *want* from me, General?"

"If you needed a scapegoat so bad, why didn't you give them whoever *did* send the order?"

"There was no order!" Egret bursts out, exasperated. "About that, the man *is* lying, clearly. I have investigated this quite thoroughly. No one *ever* ordered those men to shoot—"

"Everyone who was there is pretty clear on that point, Egret. No one was shooting until the captain passed on the order."

"And he's dead now, isn't he?" Egret asks. *"Whoopsie."*

"If he hadn't been killed, a lot more innocents would have been. This mess would be ten times worse."

"According to the *man who murdered him.*"

"No, Egret. According to the Nation border-guard who took out your bloodthirsty maniacs before they could perforate anyone's grandchildren."

Egrets goes immediately still. "You *spoke* to someone on the Nationalist side?"

I rub my forehead. "More of them than was really necessary."

She steps up and seizes me by the shoulders. "You have *contacts* there?" she hisses. "Stars and skies, Kestrel, you never *told* me."

I sigh. "I don't have 'contacts' there, Silverdawn. I went to the diplomatic switchboard and told the operator to get me someone important at Kharashenta." I give her a pointed look. "Turns out, when you singlehandedly save a whole country from being crushed by a power-hungry madwoman in a war of pitiless conquest, they take a bit of a shine to you. I know, I'm as surprised as you are."

"Kestrel!" exclaims Egret. "That is *brilliant.*" She turns, clasping her hands together. "We can use this. Maybe if we sent you as an envoy, you could convince them this was not our will. *Urgh,* why didn't I see this before? Maybe there's an honorable way out of this mess after all."

"You can usually find one," I tell her. "The trick is to bother looking."

She gives me an unimpressed glance. "I'm not going to dignify that with a response, dear."

Daisy clears her throat. "Sooo, are we going to talk about the fact Kess just assaulted the President?" She sounds almost more amused than anything.

Egret sighs. "Put on a frilly dress and people just *forget* you survived a Godforsaken *war.* It's remarkable. If the day comes that I get worked up over a *bruise* of all things, you must promise to shoot me, Daisy. I keep the pistol in the third drawer from the top."

I bite into my tongue.

"Kestrel," Egret continues, as if she hadn't just stabbed me through the heart with a serrated spear, "I am dispatching you as a special envoy to Kharashenta. You may take control of our diplomatic efforts as you see fit." She turns back to face me, watching as I take shuddering breaths and stare at the wall, her eyes betraying nothing. "Presuming you *do* still want peace with these barbarian ingrates so desperately. On the other hand, if you do decide to start a shooting war with the Nation -- intentionally or otherwise -- I will be relieved to have the matter over with."

"Ash of the Patriarchs, what did you just *do* to her, boss?" Daisy asks, staring at me, blood streaking from the hole in her chest, lifeless corpse splayed out over the—

Egret's voice is emotionless. "I reminded her what it feels like to have fingers pressed into one's gunshot wounds."

"I'd say that was uncalled for, but, well—"

"Yes." Egret turns back, seating herself again at her desk. "Arrange me a call with First Elder Birch at his earliest convenience—"

I turn to the window and stare out into the foliage below, looking for a scene that isn't strewn with corpses. "I've already been invited to a diplomatic function in Kharashenta," I say quietly, keeping my voice carefully level. I should probably want to hit Silverdawn again. Instead I just feel numb.

*She's showing me she still has power over me.*

"Well! Isn't that convenient." Egret clasps her hands together. "Have you formally accepted?"

"Not yet."

A moment's silence. Then an exasperated sigh.

"Very well. What do you want?"

"Two things. Firstly, you will immediately turn Private Ash Spring-Violet over to the custody of my officers and tear up the detainer."

"As you wish."

I take my handset from a coat pocket. "Bear, move in," I say softly. "Kid's in interrogation. Get him out of there and give him back his dignity, will you?"

*"Copy that, Kess."*

"Call me if the justiciars give you any trouble. Kestrel out." I turn, trying to steady my breathing, and fix my gaze levelly on Egret. She sighs, and lifts the receiver from her desk unit, pressing a routing switch with a manicured finger.

"Colonel? Major Bear Blackmorn will shortly be arriving to take custody of the subject. Please hand him over and cooperate with the major's requests. Thank you, dear." She replaces the receiver. "Are you satisfied?"

"Nearly." I put my hands in my coat pockets, stepping idly closer. "Now, you will apologize to the poor kid."

She gives me a suffering look. "If you insist, I will have Daisy draft a formal—"

"No." My voice is quiet, but something in it startles Egret into wide-eyed silence. "You will *apologize.* Personally. Here and now."

*"Kestrel,* I hardly think—"

My handset chirps as I raise it to my mouth. "Bear, bring him by Wagbeak's office once you've got him cleaned up."

*"Copy."*

Egret meets my gaze for a long, silent moment. When she speaks, her voice is unusually cold. "You are treading very dangerous waters, my girl. I am accustomed to recklessness from you, but this is a step too fa—"

*"You tortured a veteran of the War,"* I shout, slamming my palm down on her desk. Daisy jumps. "You took his fucking necklace from him and *tortured* him body and soul in the name of a lie. And you tell me, *me,* that *I* am taking a *step too far?* You honestly *dare?*"

Egret's eyes are wide and she pulls away from me ever so slightly, her gaze darting to and fro before falling to the floor. For one sudden moment, she looks so small and frail and frightened that I feel stung, as though I had just slapped Lily in the face.

Her every movement is so calculated that a part of me wonders if even this is a gambit, a manipulation meant to weaken my resolve.

But she nods, meekly. 

I exhale.

"So," says Daisy brightly, "who wants to talk to the First Elder?"

Egret sighs, and reaches for her receiver. "I'll speak to him first as a sign of respect and pass him to Kestrel." She gives me a brief, suffering look. *"If* that meets with the approval of our great glorious lea—"

"Ma'am," says Daisy pleadingly, and Egret, strikingly, falls silent. "If you care so much about Kess, would it really kill you not to antagonize her like that?"

Egret remains silent for a long moment. Daisy picks up a bottle and refills her glass of whiskey, which Egret throws back immediately. She sets the glass back down with an unsteady hand and flashes Daisy a fragile, grateful smile.

"You're right," she says quietly. "I'm sorry, Kestrel. This is not constructive."

Well. That's something you don't hear every day.

"Talk to Birch," I tell her. "I'll take the call when you're ready."

She nods, and lifts the receiver. "First Elder," she purrs in Khmaira, and if I didn't know her as well I as do, I wouldn't have noticed that little strain, that tiny little fragment of a hint of unsteadiness in her voice. "It is as always a sumptuous pleasure to speak with you. I *do* apologize for keeping you waiting; it was not intentional. —Yes, precisely that, in fact. I understand you've recently invited our very own General-for-Life Kestrel Winterblossom to a diplomatic soirée at Kharashenta, and it was my hope— yes, she is here. Would you like to speak with her?" She rolls her eyes. "Very good. Hold a moment, would you?"

She proffers the receiver, and I sit down on the corner of her desk to take it. "Winterblossom speaking."

"General!" Birch's crackly voice is warm and earnest. It's the first time I've actually spoken to the man, though I've heard him on recordings and conference calls before. "What a pleasant surprise this is! Not what a man expects, on a call from Destiny Garden. It is an honor to speak to you, truly."

"The honor is all mine, First Elder. Thank you for taking this call at such short notice."

"Please, I must thank you for everything you have done for our people. For this, I have not yet had the opportunity. Truly, I feel we owe you our continuing freedom to live in our own way, and I bless your name for this, ten thousand times and ten."

I can feel my cheeks reddening as I look down. "Your words are humbling, First Elder. I am grateful for whatever part fate saw fit for me to play in ensuring peace between our peoples, and I remain determined to keep that peace alive."

"Ah, this is why you call, yes? About…" His tone droops. "About that terrible tragedy that took place on our border."

"Yes." I hesitate for a moment, choosing my words carefully. "I'm not entirely certain what you've been told about that incident, by your people or mine, or the noise from our media. I'm calling to pass on the official results of our preliminary investigation, and hopefully stabilize our relationship going forward."

"The various narratives expressed thus far have been… contradictory," says Birch, diplomatically. I wince.

"I'm not surprised, and you have my personal, formal apology for this." Out of the corner of my eye I see Egret reaching for another glass of liquor. "It has been determined that responsibility for the tragedy at the border most likely lies with the Popular Republic." A sharp intake of breath from the Elder; a low groan from Egret. "Some details of the incident remain unclear, and I promise you investigations are ongoing. An order was apparently given to open fire on your people; where this order originated we're not certain. A local CO may have gone rogue and lied to his own troops, or a real order may have come down from higher up the chain."

"This…" Birch fumbles momentarily for words. "This is most unexpected. I am not one to look uncritically upon your Republic, but the viewpoint that our nation shared no responsibility for this calamity -- hitherto, this was expressed only by the most extreme of nationalist actors, those unwise ones who are unable to admit any fault in their own people." Egret bobs her head in a slow, exaggerated *gee-would-ya-look-at-that* nod. "To be quite frank with you, General, this… extremist theory which I had dismissed out of hand, you have now validated."

"I need urgently to stress that this was not a policy decision taken by our civilian leaders," I tell him quickly. "Our government absolutely remains committed to its stated policy of peaceful coexistence with yours --" An expression of alarm flashes across Egret's face, and I add, "with an eye towards eventual peaceful unification under mutually satisfactory terms." That seems to mollify her somewhat. "However, it shames me to admit that our military is… unenthusiastic about this policy. Many of our soldiers and operational-level officers were eager to seize your sovereign territory; they viewed you as nothing more than an obstacle to unchallenged planetary domination, and felt that our advanced technology would make for an easy victory."

Birch sighs. "I cannot bless you for confirming some of the most disquieting intelligence I have had the misfortune to review in recent days. This is disheartening. It was one of these men, then, who ordered my people slaughtered?"

"I have no evidence for that theory," I respond, earning a sigh of relief from Egret, "but it does seem likely, offhand. It is an avenue of investigation we will pursue forcefully; of that you have my solemn oath. Anyone who would act against the will of the people and legitimate leadership to commit a crime against peace will face the severest of penalties."

"If I heard these words from any other," Birch says solemnly, "I would disbelieve them as little more than a cowardly attempt to evade responsibility for a cruel and idiotic thing."

"You're a wise man," I respond evenly.

"Yet," Birch continues, "you I know to be a woman of the surest honor. To distrust your word is an act worthy only of Matikhe's jesters. And so I can be certain of their truth. I am grateful indeed that we are blessed by a one such as you, to shepherd peace between our nations. With myself on the one side, your Silverdawn on the other -- aye, we make a bitter couple." He laughs weakly. "Again I bless you, General. Again you have done my nation a service, for no reward but the Star-Mother's favor. Bountiful though that be," he adds piously. "Though I must ask, have you perhaps given thought to our invitations? It would honor me tremendously to toast your health in person at Kharashenta."

"It would honor me to attend you there, First Elder. I'll have my people work out an itinerary."

"Ah! Magnificent!" burbles Birch, as though he had fully expected me to decline, and I can't help but smile at the sheer unguarded delight in the old man's voice. "This is an ill day, but that shall be a glad one. _Va Mati_, I vow it!"

-- slaughter at the border was instigated by Guard provocateurs who cut into the telegraph line.--
