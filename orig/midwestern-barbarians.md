important to grasp the multifarious and foundational dimensions by which the Randani soul differs from our own, and I speak now not merely of the Zyahua people but the common soul of the Three Tribes, for we who share the bonds forged of Imperial sisterhood find ourselves, despite disparity of form, far more alike in temperament than the many barbarian peoples -- perhaps none more so than the Midwesterners.

It is gratifying, and thus far too tempting, to give into the same passions which animated Sister Owl Snowspire's famed tract, and simply denounce the hated foe with a self-assured pomposity born of total conviction of Imperial superiority. And yet, I caution you! This is but a manifestation of the very same suicidal carelessness which nearly doomed our people when we first commenced war against these barbarians, and learned the harsh lesson that chosenness alone will not secure fate of our race: that we must also be strong, disciplined, never flinching, wise of action, and cautious in temperament.
