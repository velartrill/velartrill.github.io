# Eyes of the Storm

“Rei?”

“V-Vi…”

“Rhea.” Lena takes my arm gently. “We have her on ventilation. She’s gonna be okay.”

I look up blearily, my shattered brain seizing on the last word. “Vi… she’s… she’s not gonna…?”

“She is going to survive.” Lena squeezes my arm. “With exorphine overdoses, it’s the respiratory depression that kills. It stops the breathing, and that stops you getting oxygen to your lungs, and that starves the brain and stops the heart. Do you see that face-mask on her?”

I nod.

“That’s substituting for her lungs right now. It’s pushing air in and out. See?” He taps a small screen displaying a jagged, pulsing red line. “Her heartbeat’s coming right back. She’ll be back to normal in no time.”

“She’s gonna be okay?”

He gives me a little hug. “She’s gonna be okay, Rei.”

_“Silo vade,”_ comes a brisk voice from across the room. The woman, Lena’s partner, is standing up, holding a vial in one gloved hand and aiming some kind of… miniature galvanic torch at it. It’s the pill vial, I realize.

_“Hali div?”_ Lena replies, reaching for the syringe.

There’s a pause. _“Tan,”_ comes the reply.

“L-Lena?” I ask, as he jabs the syringe into a bottle and begins filling it.

“She took five whole pills, on top of however much opium was already in her system.” He carefully eyes the markings on the syringe as he fills it; beside him, the woman is already wrapping a tourniquet around Vi’s arm, moving with the unerring accuracy of someone who’s done this many times before. “Those pills are four milligrams each, that’s an absolutely massive dose. A single one would kill me. We’re gonna give her some antifent to revive her, get her body working on its own again.” He hands the syringe to the woman, who immediately plunges it into Vi’s arm — into one of the few veins that hasn’t collapsed already — and begins to slowly squeeze the plunger.

“Th-thank you so m-m-much,” I stutter.

“No problem. Keeping you two safe is what we’re here for.”

“How did you— how are you— what is all this? How did you know how to do all this?” I whisper.

“Seli here’s a medic. She’s trained in saving people from much worse than a little overdose.”

“S-Seli?”

Seli glances at me. Her face is expressionless.

“Thank you,” I whisper hoarsely, trying to wipe the still-flowing tears from my eyes.

She nods and turns back to Vi, slowly sliding the syringe out. She passes it back to Lena, plunger first, and removes the tourniquet with one hand as she swabs the injection site with the other. Lena holds the syringe to a small metal case; there’s a snap and the needle comes off. He puts both back in the briefcase.

“Seli doesn’t talk much,” Lena says, patting me on the back. “Language was never her strong suit, and she’s always been very… focused.”

*“Wr-Wren?”*

*“Vi!”* I grab her by the shoulders, kiss her frantically on the forehead. “Oh thank God, oh thank God—”

“Wren? I— I mean… Rhea?” Vi mumbles, blinking up at me, disoriented, her pupils tiny pinpricks. Wh-what— happened?”

“You fuckin’ overdosed again, you fuckin’ idiot.” I hug her tightly, tears streaming down my cheeks. “I told you— I told you to be careful—”

Seli pulls a small black band out of the briefcase, and takes Vi’s wrist. Vi yelps, tries to pull away, but Seli ignores her resistance, wrapping the band snugly around Vi’s wrist. There’s a faint click and the ends latch together. She tugs on the bracelet experimentally; it doesn’t budge.

“She wear this until she learn self-control,” Seli declares, in the tones of a woman who doesn’t intend to be argued with.

“Wh-what? Whassat? Why?” Vi mumbles, looking back and forth between us.

“We call it a _taicon,”_ Lena murmurs, holding up his own wrist and showing me one latched there as well. “Helps us stay in touch in the field by wireless when we’re in plain clothes. And it’s got electrodes underneath that press up against the skin and measure her vital stats.”

“If her oxygen saturation drop, then I know,” says Seli. “If her heart rate drop, then I know. If she fall, then I know.” As if to demonstrate, she taps Vi’s bracelet and hers and Lena’s both light up. “So this no happen again. Two more minutes, all it would have took.” She holds up two fingers as if to emphasize. “Two. Then she would died. Incredibly lucky was this. Luck will no save her next time.”

“That’s… that’s a radio? So small?”

“That’s right.”

“Can I have one?” I blurt out. Seli immediately takes my hand and latches a band around my wrist, before snapping the briefcase shut.

“I’ll show you how they work tomorrow,” Lena tells me, gently but firmly seating me on the bed. “And we’ll get your new gun set up. Right now, you both need to rest. It’s three ‘til dawn.”

“I—”

“We’ll keep watch. If anything happens, I’ll wake you first thing, you have my solemn word.” Lena ruffles my hair again, beginning to stow the medical gear. “You can rest easy knowing we’re standing guard.”

I’m too tired to argue — and he’s probably right. I lay back, holding Vi close to me and pulling her head in under my chin. She murmurs sleepily. “If anything happens,” I murmur, “there’s a— in the back of the wardrobe, there’s a false back— the code is—”

*“Rei.* Rest.” Lena closes up the last case, hefting it off the bed. “We’ll talk strategy tomorrow, all right? Right now you *both* need sleep.”

“O-okay—” I mumble, my eyelids drooping—

—I sit bolt upright, heart pounding, reflexively shielding my eyes against the sunlight coming in through the window. Morning. It’s morning. I’m in bed — my bed… I blink rapidly, violently rubbing the sleep from my eyes, taking in my surroundings. I’m alone in here, but there’s the telltale impression in the mattress says Vi was curled up next to me not too long ago. And there’s some camo-green metal cases on the floor, marked with a strange, blocky script I’ve never seen before—

—oh God. It wasn’t a dream.

I pad softly out into the kitchen, where Vi is perched at the bar, steaming mug in hand. She beams when she sees me, proffering a coffee pot.

“Seli made _kie giang!”_ she exclaims excitedly.

“Morning to you too,” I say quietly, yawning hard and glancing up at the clock. It’s only two hours ’til noon, Empress’s tits—

—oh.

Right.

It’s all real.

It all happened.

I flop down on a barstool, putting an arm around Vi, and she snuggles up against me. “I’m so sorry about last night—” she babbles.

“Shh. ’S okay.” I rub my eyes blearily. “I’m too tired to be angry at you, babe.”

“I’d ask you if you slept well, but from how you look I guess I already know the answer,” Lena says sympathetically, shutting the oven and setting a fresh-cooked bowl of _bai shang_ on the countertop. I stare at him.

“You cook, too?”

He laughs. “Sure. Back home everyone learns to cook. We all spend time on kitchen duty now and then.”

“Well, ain’t you handy.” I nudge Vi. “Looks like I won’t have to inflict any more reheated _shie kien_ from corner store on us when you're too strung out to cook.”

“Lena’s gonna teach me how to make Society food,” Vi tells me proudly. I glare at him.

“You didn’t waste a second to start indoctrinating my girl, did you, wonder-boy.”

He flips me a lazy salute. “Not a single second, ma’am. How big a bowl would you like?”

“Big, please. I’m starving.” I pour myself a mug of coffee, and take a cautious sip. It’s sweeter than I expected, sweet and strong. Seli makes a decent cup.

Lena’s in plain clothes this morning, a light, half-sheer summer-robe with a cap to conceal his golden hair. I catch the outline of a pistol as he bends over to turn off the oven.

“Your clip is showing,” I murmur, taking another sip of coffee.

“Whoops.” Lena adjusts his robe. “Thanks; that would *not* a good thing for a man to get caught with on these streets.”

“Let your hair down and that won’t be a problem,” I observe innocently.

“Yeah, yeah, I get it, you think I’m cute,” Lena replies levelly, grinning as I feel my cheeks start to burn.

“He is, isn’t he,” Vi stage-whispers conspiratorially. I glare at her.

“I never said—”

“She’s cute when she’s flustered, isn’t she?” Vi says to Lena.

“She really is,” Lena agrees. “I mean, she’s always cute, but she's *especially* cute when she’s flustered.”

I pinch Vi’s thigh and she lets out a little yelp. “Little traitor, you,” I mutter. “Ganging up on me first thing in the morning, that’s totally fair.”

“You started it,” Vi returns innocently. “If you can’t stand the heat…”

I polish off the rest of the coffee, resting my aching forehead against the kitchen wall. “You win. You win! Have mercy, I beg you.”

“I can’t tell if she’s saying that because she actually wants us to be merciful,” Violet confides to Lena, “or if she’s just trying to egg us on. I bet she’s secretly enjoying it. She does that, you know.”

“Believe me, I’ve noticed,” Lena answers, and I bury my burning cheeks in my arms. “You should have heard the noises she was making last night.”

“Nope. Nope! Going back to bed.”

Vi giggles gleefully. “Ohhh, so it’s like that now, is it? Couldn’t resist the girly little Green, could you, babe?”

“We didn’t— I— it’s not—” I feel Lena’s hands on my shoulders and trail off in a whimper.

“She just needed some comfort, was all,” he says gently, rubbing my back slowly. “Isn’t that right, Rei?”

*“‘Rei!’* Ohmigod that’s so *cuuute,”* Vi coos, nuzzling up to me. “You’re adorable, *Rei.”*

“I swear to God I didn’t fuck the help.”

“She actually didn’t,” Lena admits, patting me on the back.

“…well. There’s still time.” Vi actually sounds disappointed. She kisses me on the shoulder, then leans back on the stool, turning to rest her feet on my lap. “What did you do to her to get her so flustered, then?”

“Really I just I gave her a backrub, but you’d never guess it from how vocal she got.”

“Ooh! Luckyyy,” Vi says coyly. “A backrub sounds *real* nice right now~”

Lena laughs. “See, Rei? Now there’s a girl who knows how to *ask* for what she wants.”

“She’s always been completely shameless like that,” I agree, fixing Vi with a glare as Lena takes her by the shoulders. She grins cheekily at me, and I let out a surprised yelp as she rubs her toe up against my clit through my nightgown. I grab her feet and squeeze my legs together. “You little *shit.”*

“She really does make such wonderful noises," Vi says dreamily.

"How are you two doing this?" I ask, staring between them.

"Doing what?" asks Lena innocently.

"Last night I found out the Shadows blew up the Empire. That the worlds are about to come apart at the seams. That twenty billion people are dead. I murdered a ghost in my nightclothes, some handsy Green fuck damn near throttled me, and my girlfriend nearly died of an overdose." I look down at my coffee. "And you're making me feel like…"

"Like things are gonna be okay?" says Lena. "That's because they are, Rei. What we're doing is caring about you. Being your comrades. Showing you you have something real, something that matters, and this storm won't take it away. That you have a home."

"A home, a great cook, and an adoring housewife," Vi coos, nuzzling up to me. "En't that right, Lena?"

"Then which one of you is the cook and which one is the housewife?"

*"Wow."* Lena whistles. "Is she *always* such a smartass?"

"Oh, you have *noooo* idea." Vi nips me on the neck before drawing back; I shiver at the tiny little rush the bite sends through me. She leans back into Lena's grip, resting her head against his chest and looking up at him slyly. "You just gotta know how to *handle* her. Mmh, God, you give the *best* backrubs."

"Don't worry, I learn fast," says Lena lightly. She shivers, closing her eyes as he presses his knuckles into her spine, massaging down to the small of her back. I feel a small pang of jealousy — of *both* of them — and turn away, digging my chopsticks into my food.

"So what's the plan for today?" I ask, trying to shift the subject away from my ritual humiliation.
