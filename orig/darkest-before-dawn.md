# Darkest Before Dawn
% by Lexi Summer Hale

I can hear the screams before the ascender capsule’s gates even retract.

It is not often that I walk these bloodstained stone floors, these dark hallways lined by one-way windows and heavy iron portals. I spend my days up in the light, in a comfortable chair for my aching back, interacting with this place only through the merciful interface of bland, clinical paperwork. Being down here makes it all too real. Reminds me how fast the pieces move about the board, how quickly strokes of fortune can reverse.

Reminds me of how I got where I am today.

Sentries on patrol and interrogators with hands full of paperwork start in alarm as they see my face, my long red silken cloak billowing out behind me. They move quickly to make gestures of fealty and obeisance, for they know entirely too well the price they might pay for perceived disrespect. I pay them little heed, not even glancing in their direction as I stride past. A sobbing, manacled prisoner is dragged unceremoniously past me by a pair of jailers, led by a bailiff. By the robes she’ll soon be shorn of, I’d take the poor helpless girl for a civil servant. A tax-collector on the take perhaps, or perhaps an embezzling burser. God knows the strokes of my pen have condemned enough of them.

To my left, through a wide doorway, I glimpse the fiery glow of the crematorium — the heart of this godforsaken place, the nexus where all its winding corridors meet. I force myself to look forward, not at what I know is going on inside. My stomach roils all the same. The stench is unmistakable.

This is the place I risk spending the rest of my days, if this goes wrong.

—then again, do I not take the same risk every day? There are no winners in the great game of politics, for nobody can win a game that never ends.

But perhaps there’s yet a way to walk away from the table.

I glance at the sigils on a short tapestry hanging overhead, seeming to shimmer in the low, flickering light of a galvanic luminator, and turn the corner. Cell Heron-6. A jailer’s standing guard at the door — that means someone’s inside. I’ve timed this just right.

I take a deep breath to calm my pounding heart, and approach.

*“You!”*

The jailer jumps at the sound of my voice, turning to face me. She blanches when she realizes who she’s looking at and drops quickly to one knee. “Y-your m—!” she begins. I cut her off.

“You *permitted* this?”

She blinks in confusion. “P-permitted—” She’s cut off by an agonized scream from the cell. I jerk my head toward the one-way window, affecting an expression of incredulity.

*“That.”*

“I— I beg pardon, your m-magnificence, I don’t—”

“Pull her out. *Now.”*

The interrogatrix looks baffled as she’s led out of the tiny cell, galvanic wand still in hand — clearly a woman who likes to do her own dirty work — but her bafflement quickly turns to surprise and fear as her gaze falls on me.

“Madame V-Vizier!” she exclaims. She falls to her knees, her white robes fluttering about her, and lowers her head respectfully. “What— how— how may I—”

I interrupt her. “What in God’s unknowable name do you call that sorry performance—” I glance at the Old Script characters adorning her left sleeve “—Pigeon Starglen?” I finish. I motion to the guard to shut the cell door. “Is that what you call *interrogation?* Blood of the Seven! I cannot *believe* the care of so vital an asset has fallen into your clumsy, feeble grip. Would it *behoove* you to explain your careless — nay, *witless* conduct ere I send you away for a lashing?”

“Dame Raven, your grace—” the guard begins, glancing back and forth in confusion between the two of us. I silence her with a glare.

“Madame,” Pigeon squeaks, lips trembling, “I— I was simply conducting the prisoner’s interrogation, session forty-six, per protocol— I cannot imagine what—”

“Per protocol? *Per protocol!?* So help me our maker but if *that* is how your mistress taught you to interrogate a woman she should share doubly in your whipping!”

“I— ten thousand apologies, your boundless magnificence, but I fail to understand;  —”

*“She was playing you.”* I aim an accusing finger at the silhouetted figure visible through the one-way window. “Like a God-bedamned _pai ĉiņ,_ if I am any judge!”

“P-playing me? H—”

“’Twas the mercy of fate alone a guard had good enough sense to report this travesty to my office. How many of our own secrets did you betray to the prisoner? What did you let slip, Starglen?”

*“Betray!?”* Pigeon’s veneer of obedience and respect is eroding. “I was interrogating *her,* not the other way ’round—”

She yelps as I slap her across the cheek with the back of my hand. “You wretched, insubordinate creature — does the concept of reverse interrogation entirely elude your limp-wristed grasp? Fie and calamity, were you apprenticed in error to a *tax collector?* Heavens *preserve* our thousand suns; ’tis certain neither of you can hope to!” I rub my forehead, squeezing my eyes shut. “Just— just go. Both of you. I shall deal with this myself.” I snatch the galvanic wand from her hand, brandishing it at her. “’Tis as well as I deserve for permitting a *girl* to do a woman’s job. Go. *Go!”*

The two confused, angry, and terrified women practically flee down the dark, cramped hallway, and I breathe a quiet sigh of relief. I twirl my keyring idly in my fingers as I unclip it from my belt, select a seldom-used master key, and unlock the cell door with a trembling hand.

The woman inside is painful to look at even from behind, where her battered body is only a black outline against a brilliant glare. And that's before I cross the room, behind the blazing luminator shining in her eyes, reducing her captors to dark, ominous shapes. Its light casts stark shadows of the manacles that dangle from the ceiling and grip her wrists high above her head. As I take in the full extent of what’s been done to her, even I can’t help but wince.

Starvation has left her ribs protruding, the skin of her waist stretched taut against the bones beneath. The sight alone of the scars and cuts along her clavicle induces a strange, ghostly sensation of pain and vulnerability in my own body, compelling me to pull my own robes tighter about my shoulders. Red marks dot her exposed crotch and breasts, galvanic contact points from a sustained current — a trick we picked up from her people, ironically enough. A good one, too, enabling even the bluntest and least sophisticated of interrogatrices to inflict the most excruciating manner of agony imaginable at the mere twist of a knob, and prolong the torment indefinitely without reducing a prisoner’s fitness for profitable labor — though enough else has been done to this particular prisoner that I doubt she would be much use on the assembly lines. Her unclothed frame is marred by so many lacerations and bruises she could almost pass for a high courtier, were the marks not so artless and vulgar. Still, I cannot deny how they accentuate her startling natural beauty. 

Her cheeks are gaunt and her bright green eyes heavy-lidded. She says nothing to me, but the flickers of motion from beneath her drooping eyelids and the faintest shift in her expression both tell me she’s sizing me up. Even now, still calculating. I can’t help but admire the girl for that kind of cold-blooded professionalism.

She looks so small, vulnerable, and fragile that it’s hard to believe the heavy titanium-alloy manacles and reinforced concrete ceiling truly are absolutely necessary to keep her from breaking free and killing me with her bare hands before I could even draw my blade.

“Why are you doing this to yourself?” I ask her. “You know there’s only one way out of this cell. There’s no point in dragging it out — all you are accomplishing is buying yourself more suffering and pain. No rescue is coming. You know that by now. What is left to you but the hope of a quick death?”

The girl’s voice is dull, accent undisguised, but I can still hear the faintest note of spite. _“Anuarash des risit, uastahin._ Beat me, shock me, cut on me, rape me all you want. It doesn’t matter. _Randasit pas uarat.”_

I step closer into the light, close enough she can see my face, and with a casual motion stab the galvanic wand into the listener deck affixed to the restraint frame. A sputter and crackle later, the reel of tape stops moving, the recorder rendered inert. I toss the wand across the room. _“A hal nare iena tili?”_ I respond quietly, gentling my voice. _And why is that?_

_That_ gets her attention. Her eyes open wide, and she stutters incoherently for a few moments. Good. All those years spent studying the secrets of our greatest foe weren’t a wild _pien şai_ chase after all.

“Wh-what— _hali narit— hali iufit— Ranuira parenan!?”_

“Only a little,” I answer, switching back to my native tongue. “Such as I have been able to cobble together from many fragmentary sources. It has been a hobby of mine. Fear not, girl; no others know my notes exist. There’s no reason any ever need to.”

“What the fuck is this? What are you t-trying to accomplish, _uastash?” Uastash_ this time, not _uastahin._ Despite herself, her tone has softened already. Progress.

“I want an answer,” I reply levelly. “An honest one. I want to know why you’re willing to suffer so much for your empire at the hands of mine. Is it your family, your children? Have they threatened harm to your loved ones should you break? Or do you expect some reward in your heathen afterlife? Help me understand why you keep feeding us false intelligence, no matter the torment it brings you.”

Her fearful eyes fixate on me. Her gaze is eerily intense for how frail, broken, and helpless she looks; she’s scrutinizing my face, searching desperately for some hint, some clue as to my purpose. My mistress trained me in all sorts of tricks to manipulate the psyche back when I was but a common apprentice; how to twist and control your body language to keep it from betraying your true inner state, and how to wield your control over the perceptions of those around you to lead them down any path of your choosing. I don’t bother with any of it. For once in my life, I really do have nothing to hide.

“I… I do n-not know what understanding of love and sacrifice a barbarian like you could possibly have,” she says at last, her lips quivering with the effort of speech, “but I… I do this for the People. I make my s-sacrifice to protect the— the f-friends, the—” She swallows hard, fresh tears glittering in her eyes, her voice wavering. “…all the loved ones I left behind.” Her gaze can no longer meet mine. Her chest shudders with the force of barely restrained sobs. “I… I make m-my sacrifice so your *defiling* hands will never, *ever* again violate our worlds or our bodies by their touch. I make my sacrifice just as so many more have done before me, may their names be written among the stars. They paid with their death and their pain for my twenty-four precious years in the one true sanctuary from hardship and cruelty that Haven has ever known, and so I pay with mine.” She’s struggling now to keep control over her voice, her whole body wrenched by the force of her unraveling emotions. “To protect the place wh-where… where gentleness and kindness and… and l-love are cherished above all. We are no *‘empire’*, profligate. We do not plunder, we do not steal, we do not enslave. Where you rape your worlds ’til they are bled barren, where you make corpses of jungles and slaves of children, we protect the weak and speak for the voiceless. We are everything you are not.” She takes a ragged breath, blinking rapidly to try to clear her eyes of tears her restraints disallow her to wipe away. “The War was only the beginning. My days are nearly done, but you… if there is justice to be found in this universe, you will live just long enough to die at my comrades’ hands.”

I exhale deeply, and step closer. She flinches as I raise my hand to her cheeks, recoiling as far as her restraints permit, plainly anticipating a blow or worse. As gently as I can, I wipe the tears from her eyes. Her skin is soft beneath my palm, though crisscrossed with the faint, rough lines of lacerations and fresh scars. ;;My touch elicits a quiet, frightened whimper and her confused and fearful eyes dart back and forth rapidly. “’Tis true, then?” I murmur. “Everything that is said about your Society? All the fanciful fables… the myths that none starve on your streets, nor live without a home? Nor nobles reign nor struggle for power? Such are not mere propaganda, colorful lies you wield to turn our common folk against us?”

“Are you… trying to toy with m-m-my mind?” the girl demands, her voice drenched simultaneously in hate and in terror. “Do your worst. No words you might say have the power to dilute even by a drop my memories of my home. They… they are realer than this cesspool of a world will ever be.”

I nod slowly. “Part of me was sure it was just an old trader’s tale, you know? The grass is always greener on the other side of the border, aye? ‘Greener.’” I let out a quiet laugh at the accidental pun. “But, no. Blood reveals the true nature of things, one way or another. You would not endure such torment for the sake of a simple lie.” I unhook my keyring, reaching up over her head, and unlock the manacles that bind her. 

She sways, staring at me in shock for a moment, grabbing onto the chains for support. I bend over to unlock her fetters, and she stumbles backwards the moment her feet are free, barely keeping her balance. Squeezing and rubbing her wrists, staring at me in slackjawed astonishment as her legs wobble unsteadily beneath her, she exclaims, “Why— what is— wh-why did you do that—?”

“Because I…” And this is it. This is the moment. The moment I finally put words to a near decade of secret planning, half a lifetime of forbidden yearning, words I never once dared speak aloud even in the privacy of my own estate — barely dared think aloud in the privacy of my own head. Forcing them past my lips is almost a physical struggle, all of my hard-won survival instincts rearing up at once in frantic alarm to prevent a folly what would in any other circumstance beget my condemnation. I ignore them.

“I wish to… to forswear the Heavenly Empire of a Thousand Suns, and in its stead pledge my fealty to your wiser and more honorable nation.” Slowly, wincing at my aching joints, I take a knee before her. “I… I pray you might be gracious and merciful enough not to kill me with your bare hands ere I can prove to you my sincerity and get you home.”

The girl grabs hold of one of the posts she was manacled to, slowly sinking to the floor and resting her back against it, a look of total and utter relief flitting across her wounded face. With visible effort she pulls her legs up protectively in front of her bare body, massaging them with her shaking hands as she takes deep, shuddering breaths. Her wide eyes don’t move from mine. “Y-you want— to *defect?* To the *Society!? You!?”*

_“Hante, surin,”_ I affirm. She gives me a dirty look.

“Y-you haven’t earned the right to c-c— call me that.”

I touch a hand to my brow, momentarily closing my eyes. “Ten thousand apologies. I beg your pardon for my transgression and pray you might forgive me for how little I understand of your ways.”

She stares at me for a moment, breathing heavily. “Wh-who the fuck even are you?” she finally manages.

“Dame Raven Goldenbough, Vizier for Defense of the Heavenly Throne and Suppression of Heresy.” I crouch down next to her and clap my fist to my heart. “At your service.”

*“Vizier for—”* She shakes her head wildly. “Y-you’re the person in *charge* of this godforsaken place? Of— of the whole fucking c-c-counter-intel program? N-novas above, you’re sat on the fucking *Privy Council!”*

“And I offer you free access to whatsoever intelligence you may require. There is a briefcase under my desk I have filled with much I thought might be of use to your cause, though you are welcome to ransack my office and run off any further documents as you see fit.” I extend a hand. “What is your name? —Well. I can keep to calling you Serenity should it suit you—”

She cautiously reaches out, timidly taking my hand; the strength of her grip is startling. “I s-suppose there’s no harm in telling you my _tashsul._ I’m… I’m Lishuen. And… I think I’d rather hear m-my real name again even if it is coming from a fucking _vittash.”_

“Then well met, Lishuen.” The word is surprisingly pronouncible. I see the corner of her lips turn upward at the sound of her name, and she exhales softly. “Here.” I reach into my robe and extract a hip-flask, unscrewing the top. “You must be thirsty.”

She snatches the flask, taking huge gulps, almost draining it before she pulls it from her lips, breathing shakily. “Th-thank you,” she whispers, upturning the flask and using the rest of the water in a desultory effort to clean her hands and face. _“An ioses tif hare…_ God, it’s been so long…”

I pull my work-satchel off my shoulder and set it on the floor, unbuckling it. “I brought you clothing as well, office vestments in which you might sneak out of here— forgive me if the garments are too large, nobody here really shares your size…”

_“Shalar a uolar!”_ Lishuen grabs for the satchel, pulling out the tightly folded bundle of tunic and trousers. She clutches it to her chest with quivering hands and stares up at me. “Oh my God. Thank you. *Thank you.”*

“Would you like help getting dressed?”

She shakes her head violently, scrabbling backwards. “No, no, *fuck* no, please, please don’t touch me—” She grabs the trousers, trying to pull them on, but her legs are so weak and her hands so shaky that she can’t even get her feet into them. She finally gives up, tears trickling from her eyes, and looks up at me wordlessly.

“Allow me.” I move closer, slowly. “I’ll just do the hard part for you, okay?”

She nods, looking away.

I unfurl the garment and slip it over her feet, feeling her muscles go suddenly tense at my touch; a whimper escapes her lips and I can tell it’s taking all her self-discipline not to reflexively pull away. I tug the trousers up over her knees and she quickly leans forward to grab the waistband, pulling them the rest of the way up and fumbling to knot the belt-cloth. The second her cunt is securely covered she seems to relax a little, a look of relief flitting across her face before she tugs the tunic down over her bruised and lacerated shoulders. I sit next to her, watching as she stretches the top down as far as it will go, hugging the cloth tight to her body, and I try to remember a skill I’ve had no use for in… decades.

Kindness.

“I know you must be in… in terrible pain,” I begin awkwardly, trying to force myself into a less formal register after decades of court politics, “but—”

“I know, I know.” She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and holds out her hands. “Help me get to my feet?” Her voice has totally lost its edge of spite and anger. She’s quiet now; quiet and suddenly timid.

“Gladly.” I take her hands in mine. She’s so light I have to stop myself from pulling too hard. She sways, wincing, as she stands, and clutches the post for support again.

“Fuck. I’m— *fuck!* I d-don’t think I can walk—”

I drape a spare cloak about her shoulders, the same deep red as mine. “Let me support you,” I murmur. I hold out my arm, and she cringes away for a moment before reluctantly drawing nearer. I put my arm around her back, under her shoulders, helping her make her way slowly towards the cell exit. I can feel how bony her back has become.

“I don’t suppose— my sidearm—”

“It’s in the evidence vault,” I reply; “all the _tian bèi_ finally gave up on making it fire. I’ve a key.”

*“…thank* you.” She hesitates. “How are we going to get out of here?”

“Let me worry about that. Just let me support you, don’t say anything, keep your hood up and your head down. A prisoner got loose of her restraints and you were injured in a fight. Nobody will look too closely at you if you’re dressed in vizierate robes, especially not if I’m shouting at them.”

_“Coshvin, til,”_ she replies softly.

“I… please forgive me, I—”

“Wilco. It means ‘wilco.’”

I nod. “Thank you. I will remember that.”

I look around sharply as we step out of the cell. The hallway is clear. “I’m going to take you up to my office while I gather some things,” I tell Lishuen. “Your weapon is among them. God willing, you shall be safe there for the moment.”

She nods, pulling the cloak’s hood up to cover her scraggly golden hair. “Do you… do you h-have a plan?”

“Yes. One I have been piecing together ever since you were transferred here.”

We make it to the end of the corridor before a jailer turns the corner. I quicken my step, doing my best not to betray my fear. She quickly notices us.

“Beg pardon, madame,” she calls as she draws near, clapping her fist to her heart in salute and glancing between us. Nervously I eye the far-caster on her belt. “Is aught the matter? Your colleague looks unwell.”

*“‘Is aught the matter?’”* I cry mockingly, not bothering to stop; the guard has to turn and hurry after us. “I should say so! ’Tis not enough the incompetence of our mere interrogators — nay, even your feckless lot must imitate them! Are your colleagues smuggling drink or worse to work, woman?”

“I— I am so sorry, your magnificence, for whatever has befallen— I— need I summon a healer, or—?” Her hand hovers near the transmit button on the far-caster. I grit my teeth.

“Perhaps instead of pestering your betters in want of an excuse to malinger further, you would be more gainfully employed in the bettering of your craft! Perhaps, say, in that arcane art of *fastening a manacle* — such that the scum of the dungeons are afforded *fewer* opportunities to wound the great and honorable of courtly society!”

Her eyebrows rise in alarm. “Has— has there been an escape? I’ve heard naught of it—”

“Very nearly so, but had there been, neither of us would yet draw breath to tell you of it, and a living *devil* would be stalking these halls, thirsty for righteous Zyahua blood! God within but those wretched Greens — they may almost look human, but make no mistake, they are anything but! And now, for want of a chain, a valuable captive lies dead and a woman of the Court is wounded, all on account of your comrades’ farcical laxity!” I wave a finger at her. “Fie! Get you gone from my sight ere I select *your* tender flesh to exercise my vexation upon!”

That does the job. Bowing and scraping, the jailer backs away, burbling fearful platitudes as she does. I hear Lishuen let out a relieved sigh. I pat her shoulder awkwardly. “Nearly there.”

“Good. I don’t know how much l-longer I can keep this up…”

We round another corner, and the ascender shaft is in sight. I reach up to my throat, take hold of the little ornament — a roundel in the mold of the House Moonwatcher crest — and touch it to the matching escutcheon that sits across the gate. Lights set into its body illuminate and a bell rings softly as the escutcheon splits down the center. The gates rattle back, clearing the way to the shaft. I tuck the amulet back under the collar of my tunic and help Lishuen into the capsule.

She leans heavily on the wall as the gates seal themselves again, gripping the handrail tight for support. I depress one of the small filigreed switches, and the ascender’s motors whir quietly to life. With a jerk, the capsule starts moving, carrying us up towards the light.

“How much further?” Lishuen asks quietly.

“Not long now. The rest of the building should be deserted at this time of day; we should have an easier time about it.”

“Wh-where are we, anyway?”

“The vizierate complex. The high offices are just across the skyway.”

The ascender motors slow, and the bell rings again. I offer the girl my hand and reluctantly she takes it, leaning awkwardly against me. We step out into the low light of a grand lobby, deserted. At the sight of the huge wall-spanning windows and the sprawling glass-and-metal complex outside, Lishuen gasps.

“Oh, God,” she whispers weakly. “I never— I never thought I’d g-get to see the night sky again.”

Despite myself, a smile crosses my lips. “Here. This way.”

The only living soul we encounter on our way through the complex is a serving-girl with a cleaning cart, on her knees and scrubbing at the floor. She doesn’t even look up as we pass. Lishuen’s eyes are glued to the windows, taking in the sight of the palace with a look of awe on her features.

“How m-much longer do we have ’til dawn?” she murmurs, sounding worried. “I can see a little light on the horizon.”

“…dawn?” I stare at her. “What in Haven do you mean?”

She looks up at me, confused. “Y-you know— sunrise. The sun coming up. Am— am I using the wrong words or—”

“…you have no idea where you are, do you?” I breathe.

Her face turns white. “N-no, I— they took me offworld— where *am* I?”

“Lishuen,” I murmur, “there will come no dawn. This world is New Carnelian, Throneworld of the Heavenly Empress, and we stand within the very Twilight Palace itself.”

Lishuen’s eyes widen and she lets out a faint gasp, staring up at me in horror. “O-oh God,” she whimpers finally. “Oh *God.”*

“My dear, where did you think you were?”

“I th-thought we were st-still in the Traverse! Not…” She pauses, blinking rapidly. “…a h-hundred parsecs from home.”

“I fear not.”

“We’re never going to make it out of here,” she whispers. “Even if we did… h-h-how are we going to make it halfway across the whole fucking Empire as fugitives? It’ll… it’ll take years by civilian craft—”

“’Tis yet a fighting chance,” I tell her. “Better than you would face chained in the dungeons, nay? Better even had you not one of the Empire’s highest potentates at your side, which you have.”

“I— I can’t believe you’re risking so much… you’re throwing away your life, just in the hope of somehow reaching my people.”

I gaze out the window, down at the waves below us, star and moonlight glinting and shivering across them. “The life I throw away is no life at all,” I say finally. “This world has broken me, and I would choose death if I cannot choose healing.”

Lishuen is quiet for a while. The only sounds are cries of seabirds and the distant roar of the ocean. “Have you ever seen… sunlight? Day?” she asks at length, in a small voice. Her eyelids are drooping; her gait is faltering. Her voice sounds just the slightest bit delirious.

I nod. “I was born far from here, in the Noon District,” I say gently. “But that was many years ago. My eyes have grown accustomed to the dark.”

“I… cannot imagine living on a world wh-where the sun… never moves in the sky. Without day or night.” She glances at me. “I suppose you’ve never known any different.”

I shake my head.

We step into another lobby, one I know intimately. The long table whence my chief clerk presides is empty, as are the many benches that fill the room. I help Lishuen into the ascender at the center of it all, and touch my pendant to an Old Script symbol on the wall. Another bell chimes, and the capsule begins to rise.

“Everything is so… big,” Lishuen murmurs.

“Is it not so on your worlds?”

“God, n… no. N-nothing like this.” She shakes her head. “I th… thought Ruby was big, but… a palace… the size of a city… built out on… on th’ ocean…”

“They say the Twilight Palace was raised up in the day of the Seventh Empress herself,” I tell her, hoping my words will keep her awake just a little while longer, and tightening my grip around her light little body to make sure she doesn’t fall. “Raised up to defy the chaos and ruin that the war left all around, to stand as a beacon of law and civilization for all of Haven. That once it was complete the Empress stood atop her high tower and reached up to set the very sun itself upon her brow, to prove her mastery and divinity against all who would deny her, and from that day it never again moved from its perch atop her throne. Nor shall it while an empress of Moonwatcher blood yet reigns.”

Lishuen looks up at me. “…d’you… believe’n that kinda thing?”

I hesitate. It’s not something I’ve ever really thought about before. “I… don’t know,” I say finally.

The ascender finally reaches the top of the tower. We step out into the center of my office, and Lishuen gasps in relief at the sight of the sofas that curve around the great circular room. “May… may I lie down?” she whispers, pointing.

“Of course!” I reply. I help her gently over to a sofa and she collapses, snuggling up against the cushions and pulling her legs in protectively against her chest. She’s crying now, all that pent-up emotion streaming out at once, tears trickling down her scarred, bruised, lacerated face.

“I thought I’d n-never get to lie down again—”

I open a wall-cabinet. “I have a blanket and a tin of _bai due._ You must be hungry.”

“Yes, p-please.” Her air of suspicion seems to have melted away and she looks up at me with an expression of pathetic gratitude as I hand her the tin of pastries. I move to drape the blanket over her and then a memory comes back unbidden.

A memory of a small child huddled on a couch, feverish, her tunic stained all over with sweat and vomit, yet still so cold even in the sweltering heat of the eternal Noon District. A memory of covering her with blankets, trying in vain to give her some kind of comfort as she wasted away from within, reduced to tears by my own helplessness.

One of my last memories of her.

I grit my teeth, push the images aside, and lay the blanket out over Lishuen. She pulls it tight around her, her shivering seeming to slowly ebb. On instinct I bend down next to her, holding out my hand.

“I’m going to get you home, Lishuen,” I whisper. “I swear to you on my honor as a woman, on the blood of the Seven, and on the name of the First Empress.”

She looks up at me for a moment, and for the first time, her eyes are gentle, her face betraying nothing but gratitude and hope, suspicion and fear washed away. Slowly, hesitantly, she reaches out to take my hand.

_“Tam elena assulafte Lishi,”_ she murmurs, finally closing her eyes. *You can call me Lishi.*

I swallow hard, nod, squeezing her palm. “I’ll… be right back, then, Lishi.”

“Stay safe, Raven,” she calls out weakly as I step into the ascender

I turn towards her as I reach for the contact on to the wall.

_“Coshvin, tam,”_ I call back, wiping a tear from my eye. _“Coshvin.”_
