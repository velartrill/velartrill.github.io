# Conspirators

With his cap and sun-spectacles on, Lena might almost pass for Kaparttu if he weren't so small. Mixed, maybe — like what a Kapa-Marak might look like, if you could imagine such a thing. Just, without the fragile bones. I slip my feet into my favorite summer sandals, watching idly as he kneels to lace up his shoes. I can't help but admire the gentle curves of his body; the slim muscles beneath the dark tan of his skin. He catches my eye and smirks that fucking smirk of his when I look away, redfaced.

"Enjoying the view?"

"Where'd you even get shoes your size 'round here?" I ask him, right anxious to change the subject. "Nab 'em off a Kapa midget, did you?"

"The magic of requisitions," he replies. "Cute sandals you got there."

"Thanks." I gaze fondly at the pair, flexing my toes. "Bought 'em at market when I was seventeen. Only thing I have left of my homeworld, really."

He whistles. "They're sturdier than they look. They've lasted all those years?"

I nod. "Near on a dozen now. A bit dinged up but none the worse for wear. Back on Sapphire they make things to last."

He finishes lacing up and stands. His movements are so… easy and fluid; his body language practically screams confidence and power. "Do you miss Sapphire?" he asks.

I shrug. "It's just a place. Wasn't as though I had me a particular good life there, anyhow. How's about you? You miss… wherever you come from?"

"Tel Listel." He smiles wistfully. "I do.  But I need to see this through, you know? It wouldn't feel right, crawling to homespace with my tail between my legs and leaving a job unfinished."

I gaze at him appraisingly. "You sure that's all it is?"

He raises his eyebrows. "What do you mean?"

"What you told me about your unit — how many people left on Tel Listel do you actually still know by name, Lena?"

He's quiet for a moment, his gaze dropping. "Ah. Yeah," he says finally. "That."

"I ain't been a soldier myself, but I've known ’em, worked alongside ’em." I step closer, touching him gently on the shoulder. "Some of them, the conscripts, they just want to do their time and get back on home to their family. Some of them want to bring home slaves and spoils of war from a fresh new conquest, set up a nice, respectable city household. But folks as enlist outright — they got different stories."

"You think I'm running from something."

"There's three things’ as'll make a woman — or a man, I s'pose — choose to keep fightin’ when she's all alone and lost it all to war. There's anger, right. Your standard lust for vengeance, to get back at the  people who took your comrades from you even if it costs you your life, on account of it not matterin' much anymore without them. But you ain't a vengeful kind, I see that in you plain.

"Then there's fear for the folks back home — knowing their lives rest on your shoulders. I reckon there's some of that still in you, but it's like you said; war's damn near done with. Sounds like Team Empress don't pose too much more a threat to your kind, with the bloodthirsty old biddy dead and Carnelian ash.

"There's something else, though." I look him in the eye, touching him gently on the cheek. "You been fighting this war since I was a girl. Twenty damn years of your life, give or take. War's most everything you know, and when you get home, one lonely survivor of the Sixth, well — what have you really got to look forward to there, anyhow?"

Lena takes a deep, shaking breath. "You put all that together on you own, did you, Rhea-*virtash?"* he asks, eyes fixed on mine.

*"Virtash?"* I ask, blinking.

"Right. Sorry. Uh…" He hesitates, closing his eyes for a moment. "Sorry, it's not a bad thing or anything — I don't know if you have a word for it. It means someone who's trained to understand how the mind works, how *people* work. Back home everyone has a *virtash* they see now and again, to help you learn how to process and manage your emotions as you mature, and they help you heal when your mind is… wounded? Traumatized? They're sort of like… medics, but for the spirit, not the body. Is there a Zia Ţai word for that, do you know?"

I hesitate. "I… don't know. We got the priestesses, I suppose? Though their advice is as liable to be chickenshit as gold."

"…that explains a lot," Lena murmurs, his tone sympathetic.

"E-explains what?"

"You. Your culture. This whole fucking Empire-that-was." He laughs weakly. "Everyone is so driven by their basest emotions. Everyone is so damaged and they don't even know it. I just thought your *virtashar* were idiots, but turns out you don't even *have* them." He lets out a low whistle. "Yikes."

I narrow my eyes. "You think I'm *damaged,* do you?"

He laughs, putting a hand around the scruff of my neck and tugging me gently closer. "Rei, you are *so* damaged. Hey, don't give me that look — it's not an insult." He squeezes the back of my neck gently. "You've been through some bad things, by the sound of it, and you haven't had much in the way of support all these years. I'm hoping that being with us will give you a chance to heal up a bit, get your feet on solid ground."

Something about his touch makes me go limp in his hands. Unable to pull away, unable to look away, unable to mount a token resistance. The feeling of his hand on such a tender, intimate part of my body has set my heart pounding and turned me mute. My limbs are trembling, my lips moving wordlessly. Lena gazes deep into my eyes for a moment, the intensity of his stare feeling like a white-hot blade through my spirit, and finally, he pulls me closer and hugs me tightly. Gratefully, I wrap my shaking arms around his back and bury my head in his shoulder. I can feel tears trickling down my cheek. Tears of what, I don't know.

I am so glad Vi isn't here to see this.

"Y'alright there, Rei?" Lena murmurs, a note of concern in his voice.

"I just… I'm—" I never want this to end. I never want to be freed from this soft, warm, powerful embrace, and I can't restrain a faint vocalization as he strokes the back of my neck with a hand. God alive, it's like I imprinted on him or something last night — I can't even think straight in his grip.

—Is this how Vi feels when I hold her?

"Shh. It's okay." Lena touches his cheek to mine. "We've got some time before we need to leave."

He holds me there in the foyer for a few long minutes, until some sense finally begins to reassert itself. Slowly, reluctantly, I pull away, flinching away from his gaze, and he lets me. "I'm— I'm sorry," I mumble, humiliated; "I—"

"Hey. It's okay." Lena pats my shoulder. "See, when I say you're damaged, Rei? It's things like this. You put up a real good façade but it keeps cracking, and I keep seeing little glimpses of the woman you are deep down."

"D-do you now."

He laughs softly. "You're not the only one can read people. Hey. It's okay. We don't gotta talk about it now. I don't want to force you too far outta your comfort zone. Just… know that when you're ready to talk, or any time you need comfort, I'm here."

"Thank y-you," I mumble, cheeks burning.


Lena stops me with a hand to my chest, glancing quickly to and fro before darting out into the corridor. He cases it thoroughly, checking sight-lines and peering behind corners, before nodding to me and beckoning. I follow, pulling the door shut behind me, listening careful for the click of the self-locking mechanism, and can't help but do my own recon as I walk towards him -- I'm not used to having someone else to do the hard work for me, and as much as I know his senses are far keener'n mine, I can't quite silence the steady stream of what-ifs from that dark, paranoid little part of my brain. The part of my brain that keeps me alive.

He doesn't seem to take it as a sign of distrust, though. Just smiles that gentle smile of his, touches me real soft on the shoulder and directs me gently down the hallway. "You know I live here, right," I murmur, and he laughs.

"Sorry. Force of habit. Lead the way, red."

He takes my hand as we walk, fingers entwining with mine, and I catch myself squeezing his hand tight before I realize what I'm doing and try to yank away. It's useless, of course, his grip is unbreakable, and he smirks at me as my face reddens. "Oh, do you want me to let go?" he asks innocently, idly rubbing my thumb with his. "Just say the word."

"I--" I stammer. Lena watches me expectantly.

"Yes~?"

"I… ah… right, yeah, no, this is a… a good idea," I finally finish lamely. "Helps our, our… our cover, right?"

"Our *cover~?"* he teases. "And what would that be, Rei? Boyfriend and girlfriend? Husband and wife? Please, I'm all ears -- you're way better attuned to the streets here; best let you handle the sneaky stuff, _ne?"_

Why does that boy delight in tormenting me so?

"Or," he continues gleefully, as I continue to stammer, "you could just admit that some basic, cozy intimacy is nice when you're feeling rattled. But that would be a bit too easy for a super-spy like you, wouldn't it?"

*"I--"*

"—Speaking of which," he adds, his voice turning serious, and I'm almost grateful for the interruption, "I couldn't help but notice you seem to have a little bit of a tremor going on today. That normal for you?"

For a moment I just stare at the carpet underfoot. "Not really," I mutter finally, as Lena presses the contact on the ascender panel.

"Has this ever happened before?" He squeezes my hand softly, looking up at me with his piercing green eyes. I can't meet his gaze.

"Only once," I reply at length. The chime rings and the ascender capsule slides slowly into view, the gate lattice unlatching. Lena pulls it open and leads me gently through, shutting it behind us.

"Lobby, please," he says to the attendant, a mousy little Marakki woman I haven't seen before. Instinctively I take stock of her, parsing out the little details of her body language, the lines and folds of her uniform, the way the fabric of her uniform distorts as her body moves. The bruise under her left eye. No concealed weapon, no martial training — my rational mind scoffs at the thought; a Marak? She'd break her arm if she so much as threw a punch at me. I relax fractionally, offering her a token smile as she twiddles the dials and switches that control the contraption we're standing on.

"When was that, if you don't mind me asking?"

"Hm?" I glance back up at Lena, train of thought derailed. "S-sorry, what were we talking about?"

I can tell by his expression he thinks I'm being evasive. He lifts my palm with both hands, loosening his grip enough for the tremor to show again.

"Oh. Right. That." I look away again.

"You said it happened before?" He steps closer, leaving me backed into the corner,  touching me softly on the neck as he takes me by the hand. I can feel my heart pounding; an image filling my mind unbidden of Lena pressing his knee up between my inner thighs and pinning my wrists to the wall — *focus,* you hormonal fucking teenager of a woman. _La dè nai!_

"I— I, I—" I stammer, trying to meet his gaze and flinching away. He frowns, squeezing my neck a little, rubbing the tender spot behind my ear with his thumb — *God, why does that feel so good* — and taking another step closer.

"Hey," he says, his voice full of concern. "We don't have to talk about it now, okay? Looks like it was something bad, and I don't want to drag you back through that."

I nod shakily, exhaling raggedly as he pulls me into a hug and burying my face in his shoulder. "I— I'm sorry, I don't kn-know what the fuck is wrong with me—" I babble, but he shushes me.

"It's okay, Rei. Last night was rough."

"This whole month was rough," I murmur, and he squeezees me tighter.

"Just remember, it's gonna be okay. Okay? You have my word, one way or another."

I can't help but laugh. Promises! What youthful naïveté. Still, I can't deny being held like this… makes me feel so warm and safe that his words ring true all the same.

We're nearing the lobby so reluctantly, I disentangle myself. Lena steps back, letting me out of the corner, and as I move to his side I offer him my hand, which he takes with a smile. "Attagirl, red."

_"Kire misekan,"_ I tell the attendant as the elevator alights on the ground floor, and she looks startled to hear her native tongue on the lips of Zyahua. She babbles something I can't understand in reply but I nod and smile anyway as Lena leads me out into the lobby. Never hurts to be kind to the service staff — they're the ones with the keys, as the bluebloods so often forget.

"You speak Kimer Marakki?" Lena asks, sounding surprised. "You didn't mention that the other night."

I laugh quietly. "I can say *thank you* in near two dozen tongues, if that counts as 'speaking.' I have no idea what that"


"You sure love being manhandled, don't you?"
