With his cap and sun-spectacles on, Lena might almost pass for Kaparttu if he weren't so small. Mixed, maybe — like what a Kapa-Marak might look like, if you could imagine such a thing. Just, without the fragile bones. I slip my feet into my favorite summer sandals, watching idly as he kneels to lace up his shoes. I can't help but admire the gentle curves of his body; the hint of taut muscle beneath the dark tan of his skin. He catches my eye and smirks that fucking smirk of his when I look away, redfaced.

"Enjoying the view?" he teases.

"Where'd you even get shoes your size 'round here?" I ask him, right anxious to change the subject. "Nab 'em off a Kapa midget, did you?"

"The magic of requisitions," he replies. "Cute sandals you got there."

"Thanks." I gaze fondly at the pair, flexing my toes. "Bought 'em at market when I was seventeen. Only thing I have left of my homeworld, really." No, that's wishful thinking. I still have the memories too.

He whistles. "They're sturdier than they look. They've lasted all those years?"

I nod. "Near on a dozen now. Been to the cobbler's a few times but none the worse for wear. Back on Sapphire they make things to last."

He finishes lacing up and stands. His movements are so… easy and fluid; his body language practically screams confidence and power. "Do you miss Sapphire?" he asks, eyes fixing on mine.

I shrug. "It's just a place. Wasn't as though I had me a particular good life there, anyhow. How's about you? You miss… wherever you come from?" I ain't shy of eye contact but something about Lena's attention feels… overwhelming, right now.

"Tel Listel." Lena smiles wistfully. "I do.  But I need to see this through, you know? It wouldn't feel right, crawling back to homespace with my tail between my legs and leaving a job unfinished."

I gaze at him appraisingly. "You sure that's all it is?"

He raises his eyebrows. "What do you mean?"

"What you told me about your unit — how many people left on Tel Listel do you actually still know by name, Lena?"

He's quiet for a moment, his gaze dropping. "Ah. Yeah," he says finally. "That."

"I ain't been a soldier myself, but I've known ’em, worked alongside ’em, bought ’em drinks and listened to their war stories." I step closer, touching him gently on the shoulder. "Some of them, the conscripts, they just want to do their time and get back on home to their family. Some of them want to bring home slaves and spoils of war from a fresh new conquest, set up a nice, respectable city household. But folks as enlist outright — they got different tales to tell."

"You think I'm running from something."

"There's three things’ as'll make a woman — or a man, I s'pose — choose to keep on fightin’ when she's all alone and lost it all to war. There's anger, right. Your standard lust for vengeance, to get back at the  people who took your comrades from you even if it costs you your life, on account of it not matterin' much anymore without them. But you ain't the revenge-minded kind, I see that in you plain, and if I ain't badly mistaken you got things to live for yet.

"Then there's fear for the folks back home — knowing their lives all rest on your shoulders. I reckon there's some of that still in you, but it's like you said; war's damn near done with. Sounds like Team Empress don't pose too much more a threat to your kind, with the bloodthirsty old biddy dead and Carnelian ash.

"There's something else, though." I look him in the eye, my hand moving to the side of his neck. "You been fighting this war since I was a girl. Twenty damn years of your life, give or take. War's most everything you know, and when you get home, one lonely survivor of the Sixth, well — what have you really got to look forward to there, anyhow?"

Lena takes a deep breath. "Y-you put all that together on your own, did you, Rhea-*virtash?"* he asks in a quivering voice, lips a-tremble, eyes widening. His gaze damn near burns, but with effort I hold it.

*"Virtash?"* I ask, blinking. It feels good to hear the boy stammer for just a fleeting moment, to see that façade of pure confidence and strength falter. Despte the pointed ears, he suddenly looks a lot more human to my jaded eyes.

When you're a spy long enough, you come to feel the little shifts and eddies in the currents of power around you almost like a sixth sense hooked straight into your soul. And for a moment there, I felt the playing field tilt decisive-like in my direction.

"Right. S-sorry. Um…" Lena hesitates, closing his eyes for a moment, collecting himself; I can see his manner shift right before my eyes. The self-control it takes to bounce back so damn quickly — tomboy's made of stern stuff. "Sorry, it's not a bad thing or anything," he begins finally, "I don't know if you have a word for it."

"How's that? What's it mean, then?"

"It means someone who's… trained to understand how we all think, how people *work,"* he replies after a moment of thought. "See, back home everyone has a *virtash* they see now and again, to… well. They help you learn how to process and manage your emotions as you mature, help you connect with the right people, that kind of thing. And they help you heal when your mind is… wounded? Traumatized? They're sort of like… medics, but for the spirit, not the body. Is there a Zia Ţai word for that, do you know?"

I hesitate. "I… don't know. We got the priestesses, I suppose? Though their advice is as liable to be chickenshit as gold."

"…that explains a lot," Lena murmurs, his tone sympathetic.

"E-explains what?"

"You. Your culture. This whole fucking Empire-that-was." He laughs weakly. "Everyone is so driven by their basest emotions. Everyone is so damaged and they don't even know it. I just thought your *virtashar* were idiots, but turns out you don't even *have* them." He lets out a low whistle. "Yikes."

I narrow my eyes. "You think I'm *damaged,* now?"

He laughs, putting a hand around the scruff of my neck and tugging me gently closer; I stumble, suddenly disoriented. "Rei, you are *so* damaged. Hey, don't give me that look — it's not an insult." He squeezes the back of my neck gently and my heart starts pounding like crazy. "You've been through some bad things, by the sound of it, and you haven't had much in the way of support all these years. I'm hoping that being with us will give you a chance to heal up a bit, get your feet on solid ground."

Something about the way he's holding me is just… paralyzing. I can't pull away, I can't look away, I can't mount even a token resistance. My limbs are trembling, my lips moving mutely as I grope in the dark for words that won't come. The strange feeling of helplessness sends a jolt of panic up my spine but my mind feels… pinned down, trapped in his grip, and I can't hardly think. Lena gazes deep into my eyes for a moment; the intensity of his stare feels like a white-hot blade through my spirit. Finally, he pulls me closer and hugs me tight. Gratefully, I wrap my shaking arms around his back and bury my head in his shoulder. I can feel tears trickling down my cheek. Tears of what, I don't know.

I am so glad Vi isn't here to see this.

"Y'alright there, Rei?" Lena murmurs, a note of concern in his voice.

"I just… I'm—" What is wrong with me. What *happened* to me? "I… d-don't kn-kn-know," I manage finally.

"Shh. It's okay." Lena touches his cheek to mine. "We've got some time before we need to leave."

He holds me there in the foyer for a few long minutes, until some sense finally begins to reassert itself. Slowly, reluctantly, I pull away, and he lets me. I flinch away from his gaze. "I'm— I'm sorry," I mumble, humiliated; "I—"

"Hey. It's okay." Lena pats my shoulder. "See, when I say you're damaged, Rei? It's things like this. You put up a real good façade but it keeps cracking, and I keep seeing little glimpses of the woman you are deep down."

I squeeze my arm. "D-do you now."

He laughs softly. "You're not the only one can read people. Hey. It's okay. We don't gotta talk about it now. I don't want to force you too far outta your comfort zone. Just… know that when you're ready to talk, or any time you need comfort, I'm here."

"…th-thank you," I mumble, cheeks burning.

"Can I ask you something?"

With difficulty, I force myself to look at him. Trying to meet his gaze feels like trying to steer a skittish *şue phin;* my body don't want to, no matter how desperate I am to save face. "Yeah, sh-shoot," I reply, and I realize I'm tugging the folds of my robe together across my body, my arms crossing down by my thighs. *What in ash is* wrong *with me?*

"We have a *virtash* in our group. If she'd be willing to sit down and talk to you, is that something you'd be up for giving a try?"

"Wh-what would be the point of that, then?"

"The point," Lena says softly, touching my arm, "would be, maybe she could help you start to heal some of this damage."

I give a weak laugh. "Ashes, Lena, I don't even half know what *this damage* is."

"Yeah. That's the point." He strokes my arm. "Maybe she could help you figure that out."

"I'm… I don't know. I'll think about it."

"Alright. That's all I ask."


Lena stops me with a hand to my chest, glancing to and fro before stepping out into the corridor. He cases it, quickly but thoroughly, checking sight-lines and glancing around corners, before nodding to me and beckoning. I follow, pulling the door shut behind me, listening careful for the click of the self-locking mechanism, and can't help but do my own recon as I walk towards him. I'm not used to having someone else to do the hard work for me, and as much as I know his senses are far keener'n mine, I can't quite silence the steady stream of what-ifs from that dark, paranoid little part of my brain. The part of my brain that keeps me alive.

He doesn't seem to take it as a sign of distrust, though. Just smiles that little smile of his, touches me real soft on the shoulder and directs me down the hallway. "You know I live here, right," I murmur, and he laughs.

"Sorry. Force of habit. Lead the way, red."

He takes my hand as we walk, fingers entwining with mine, and I catch myself squeezing his hand tight before I realize what I'm doing and try to yank away. It's useless, of course, his grip is unbreakable, and he smirks at me as my face reddens. "Oh, do you want me to let go?" he asks innocently, idly rubbing my thumb with his. "Just say the word."

"I--" I stammer. Lena watches me expectantly.

"Yes~?"

"I… uh, right, yeah, no, this is a… a good idea," I finish lamely. "Helps our, our… our cover, right?"

"Our *cover~?"* he teases. "And what would that be, Rei? Boyfriend and girlfriend? Husband and wife? Please, I'm all ears -- you're way better attuned to the streets here; best let you handle the sneaky stuff, _ne?"_

Why does the boy delight in tormenting me so?

"Or," he continues gleefully, as I continue to stammer, "you could just admit that some basic intimacy is nice when you're feeling rattled. But that would be a little too easy for a super-spy like you, wouldn't it?"

*"I--"*

"—Speaking of which," he adds, his voice turning serious, and I'm almost grateful for the interruption, "I couldn't help but notice you seem to have a little bit of a tremor going on today. That normal for you?"

For a moment I just stare at the carpet underfoot. "Not really," I mutter finally, as Lena flicks the call switch in the ascender alcove.

"Has this ever happened before?" He squeezes my hand again, looking up at me with his piercing green eyes. I can't meet his gaze.

"Only once," I reply at length. The chime rings and the ascender capsule slides slowly into view, the gate lattice unlatching. Lena pulls it open and leads me gently through, shutting it behind us.

"Lobby, please," he says to the attendant, a mousy little Marakki woman I haven't seen before. Instinctively I take stock of her, parsing out the little details of her body language, the lines and folds of her uniform, the way the fabric of her clothing distorts as her body moves. The bruise under her left eye. No concealed weapon, no martial training — my rational mind scoffs at the thought; a Marak? She'd break her arm if she so much as threw a punch at me. I relax fractionally, offering her a token smile as she twiddles the dials and switches that control the contraption we're riding in.

"When was that, if you don't mind me asking?"

"Hm?" I glance back up at Lena, train of thought derailed. "S-sorry, what were we talking about?"

I can tell by his expression he thinks I'm being evasive. He lifts my palm with both hands, loosening his grip enough for the tremor to show through again.

"Oh. Right. That." I look away again.

"You said it happened before?" He steps closer, leaving me backed into the corner,  touching me softly on the neck as he takes me by the hand. I can feel my heart pounding; an image filling my mind unbidden of Lena pressing his knee up between my inner thighs and pinning my wrists to the wall — *focus,* you hormonal fucking teenager of a woman. _Sang giun La nai!_

"I— I, I—" I stammer, trying to meet his gaze and flinching away. He frowns, squeezing my neck a little, rubbing the tender spot behind my ear with his thumb — *God, why does that feel so good* — and taking another step closer.

"Hey," he says, his voice full of concern. "We don't have to talk about it now, okay? Looks like it was something bad, and I don't want to drag you back through that."

I nod shakily, exhaling raggedly as he pulls me into a hug and burying my face in his shoulder. "I— I'm sorry, I don't kn-know what the fuck is wrong with me—" I babble, but he shushes me.

"It's okay, Rei. Last night was rough."

"This whole month was rough," I murmur, and he squeezes me tighter.

"Just remember, it's gonna be okay. Okay? You have my word, one way or another."

I can't help but laugh. Promises! What youthful naïveté. Still, I can't deny being held like this… makes me feel so warm and safe that his words ring true all the same.

We're nearing the lobby so reluctantly, I disentangle myself. Lena steps back, letting me out of the corner, and as I move to his side I offer him my hand, which he takes with a smile. "Attagirl, red."

_"Kire misekan,"_ I tell the attendant as the elevator alights on the ground floor, and she looks so startled to hear her native tongue on the lips of Zyahua. She babbles something I can't understand in reply but I nod and smile anyway as Lena leads me out into the lobby. Never hurts to be kind to the service staff — they're the ones with the all keys, as the bluebloods so often forget.

"You speak Kimer Marakki?" Lena asks, sounding surprised. "You didn't mention that the other night."

I laugh quietly. "I can say *thank you* in near two dozen tongues, if that counts as 'speaking.' I have no idea what she was saying to me."

Lena nods. "Right, right; that makes sense. I think Rose is the only person I know who's actually bothered to learn it."

"Overacheiver," I mutter. I tug Lena towards the main desk as we step through the outer door of the complex. "Hawthorn!" I call in Khmaira. "How are you holding up, old man?"

The day-clerk smiles up at me, setting his quill aside. "Never better, young mistress. Eh, who's your lovely young man, now? I don't believe I've had the pleasure."

"Hawthorn, this is Savannah," I tell him, patting Lena on the shoulder. Making up names comes so easy to me these days it's damn near an instinct. "If he comes by, you let him right on in, will you?"

"It'll be my pleasure," Hawthorn replies, scribbling something in his ledger. "Young master Savannah, so very good to meet you!" he adds in Zia Ţai, shaking Lena's hand fervently.

"Likewise, master Hawthorn," Lena replies in Khmaira, and Hawthorn's smile broadens.

"It's certainly far past time the young lady found a decent boy to settle down with," he remarks conspiratorially, winking at Lena. "With such a fine facility for language, no less! She does have fine taste, does she not?"

Of course he had to go there. "Come on," I say, tugging Lena's shoulder and rolling my eyes. "We don't want to be late, and Hawthorn'll talk your ear off all day if you let him."

Hawthorn lets out a wheezy laugh. "Don't let her tough hide fool you, boy — Wren's all heart once you get to know her."

"Is she, now?" Lena asks, the corner of his lip curling upward as he leans forward, ignoring my increasingly urgent tugs on his arm. "Do tell!"

"Oh, yes, as fine a woman as there ever was," Hawthorn continues merrily. "As generous as the day is long and a solid friend when push comes to shove. Why, I can't count all the favors and advice she's given me over the years — and such a gentle soul, truly! You're in for a bright future if you can keep her affections, my lad — she'd no more beat a husband than her own wife, I daresay."

"Quite the opposite, I hear," Lena replies casually, and I can't keep my eyes from widening.

*"Okay time to go,"* I blurt, yanking desperately on his arm, and *finally, Khata'e be blessed,* he listens.

"Well, it was a pleasure, master Hawthorn," he says, bowing slightly. "We simply *must* speak more when we've time."

"Take care, dear boy! I shall be seeing a great deal more of you, I hope." Hawthorn holds up a hand in farewell as Lena turns, and I practically drag him out the front door.

The streets of Chandler's Landing can never be said to be truly deserted, not even during the darkest hours of the night, but the mid-day bustle has calmed since noon. Despite it's name, the city is industrial to the core, and nearly half the population are working-class commoners -- "proletarians," as Lena might say. By and large they're squirreled away in the great Eastgate foundries and will be 'til shift's end at sunset, now that the lunchtime hours have come to their close. In any case, scarce few can bear the heavy costs of Uptown life; most of the folks we pass are messengers, slaves, the odd tradeswoman or apprentice, and greycloaks on patrol.

I'm fond of Uptown, I'll admit. It's unlike the pitiful slums where the petty laborers eat and shit and fuck and not much else, but also the soulless, sterile hauteur of the White Thorn District. It's got class *and* character -- and most important of all, rates just low enough that someone of my station can eke out a cozy living.

I'm on high alert, but we pass homes, apartment blocks, restaurants, shops, and a shrill-voiced dowager beating a slave in the middle of the street without incident. "No black-windowed coach?" I ask Lena. "Normally this is the part where I get manhandled by goons and dragged halfway across the city in handcuffs and a blindfold."

"Well, I was just going to show you the way to the safehouse," he replies, "but if you'd prefer to be manhandled~"

I clear my throat, reddening. "…just like that? You're trusting me with your secrets already?"

Lena laughs. "Rei, do you really think we only have one safehouse in this city?"

"I… suppose not."

"Down here." He tugs my arm, and we turn right towards a flight of stairs down into the Underground. The little voice in the back of my head pipes up again and I rummage in my purse for my passbook -- my *real* fake one, not my government-issue fake one -- to make sure it's stamped with this moon's rail pass. With stakes this high, getting caught out for a *fare evasion charge* would be the height of all irony.

But the stamp is there all right, up in the corner next to a ration debit, and I breathe a quiet sigh of relief as I slip it back into my purse. "Which line?" I ask Lena, and he points.

"The Circulator. We're just a couple stops northbound."

Uptown Station is one of the main changeover points in the network, and it's about as busy as train stations get. There's an arrival near every minute, and occasionally an express comes barreling through towards the outer boroughs or Shrike's Corner. As we near the northbound platform, the noise rises and rises, a din of screeching wheels, raised voices, and motors -- none of the snorts, whinnies, and endless whuffling of _şue phin,_ horse, and _pien şai_ that I grew so accustomed to from the streetcars of my homeworld, where you'd think nobody'd ever heard of galvanics or steam engines. Say what you will about the Duchess, but she runs a tight ship.

I gravitate towards the far corner, finding an empty bench I can survey the whole platform from, and Lena follows my cue, sitting down next to me, and putting an arm around my shoulders.

Something… changes. My heart starts racing out of nowhere, and suddenly I feel very, very small. Small and vulnerable. My back and my thighs are suffused with phantom pain— and for a brief moment, lost in some mad delirium, I imagine I see *her* sitting next to me. Curly red hair cascading down her shoulders, freckled cheeks, with all those sharp little scars that decorate her body—

—and then I blink my watery eyes, and the image is gone, and Lena is sitting next to me again, gazing at me quizzically. Slowly I regain control of my body, trying to fight the feeling of helplessness and force my brain back into spy mode. It's like I've suddenly been locked out of my years of training and decades of experience and all of a sudden I'm just a fragile civilian again. I realize my head is resting on his shoulder, and sit up straight, cheeks burning.

"You doing all right there, Rei?" he asks.

I look away, but he catches me by the chin, pulls my head back to face him. He cups my cheeks in his hands, ignoring my attempts to pull away and brushing the tears away from my eyes with his thumb. Something about the tenderness and warmth of his touch just makes me want to cry all the harder, but I manage to muster some final shred of dignity and hold back the tears this time.

"You wanna tell me about it?" he asks.

I shake my head.

He pats my cheek. "Alright. That's okay. Anything I can do in the meantime?"

"I—" I swallow hard, try to find the right words for a moment before I give up and scoot closer. He wraps his arms around me and hugs me tightly, and hesitantly, I let my head rest against his shoulder.

"Nobody's treated you like this in a while, have they, Rei?"

I shake my head.




"Lena… can you hold me for a bit?" "You asked about… about my hands shaking. Last time that happened was wh— whe— I— I, I—" I feel like my tongue's tripped over the words in my mouth and I can't make them come out. I stutter helplessly for a moment, and suddenly my whole body is shaking. Then I feel the sting of tears in the corners of my eyes, and the next thing I know I'm curled up in a ball on Lena's lap, silently sobbing, my face buried in his shoulder.

I feel humiliated. But he doesn't laugh. He doesn't mock me. He just holds me tight, hugs me close to his chest. Ruffles my hair, tells me it's okay, tells me to take my time. I just want to blurt it out and get it over with but I can't make the words come out.

"I was sh-sh-shadowing him," I finally manage. "They had to go into the city every now'n again to buy the drugs, so I found the d-d-dealer and I just wait until he shows up. And I follow him out into the forest and they catch me." I'm hyperventilating, I realize. My words are spilling out my mouth like an overflowing bucket. "It was a week before I could escape. A w-w-week. They had me for a wh-whole week—"

"Who—?" Lena murmurs.

"Him. From the other night." I can't make myself say his name. "He caught me out in the forest and I— I was there f-f-for a week. A whole week. They used me. They used me and used me and used me. I can't make them stop. They won't stop hurting me, they're tearing my clothes off and he won't stop choking me, I can't breathe, I can't— he's—"

"Rhea. Hey." Lena hugs me tightly. "It's all over. It was all a long time ago—"

"I know! I *know!"* I choke back a sob. "But it still won't stop. Why won't it stop? Why do I keep seeing it? I know it's over so why won't it stop—"

"Oh, Rei."

"I'm sorry, I'm so—"

"Shh. No. Don't say that. You didn't do anything wrong. Shh." He strokes my arm softly. "Rei, you poor, poor thing. I had no idea."

"He was gonna do it all over again. In my own fucking home." I can't see for the tears filling my eyes. "He was gonna hold me down and tear off my clothes again and— and he's gonna do it to Vi, and—"

"And he's dead. He's dead, Rei. We killed him. You put a bullet square between his eyes, we both saw it happen. He can't hurt you anymore."

"He was supposed to burn. He was supposed to burn with the others! The justiciar— they told me— they told me they had them all, they—"

"Rei. Nothing is gonna happen to you. Nothing is gonna happen to Violet. We are not going to let anything happen. *I* am not going to let anything happen. Never, never fucking again, you hear me?" Even Lena sounds agitated now, fury and indignation simmering in his voice. "Nobody is ever going to use you again."

"I thought I was gonna die. It hurt so bad. I tried and tried and I couldn't get any air. Everything would go black and then suddenly I'm on the ground and he's kicking me, taking his clothes off— every time I tried to fight back he'd just grab me around the throat and I thought I was gonna die until I was t-too scared to fight, I just let him because I didn't want to die—"

I bury my head in Lena's shoulder, and he holds me tight as the tears stream from my eyes and my whole body reverberates with the force of my sobs.

"I'm so sorry," Lena says at length. "No wonder— God within, I'm a fucking asshole. I'm so sorry, Rei."

"Wh-what—? Wh-what for—"

"The way I— the way I've been touching you—" He shakes his head. "God, no wonder you freaked when I touched your neck. I won't ever do that again, I promise."

"Why…? What do you mean?"

He idly strokes my cheek with his thumb. "Rei, when you go through something that bad— well, it's like a scar, right? You get in a knife fight and the would heals up but there's still a mark years later, it still hurts when you press on it. The soul's no different. Doesn't matter than I'm not him. I was still a man grabbing you by the neck."

"…no. No, it wasn't like that."

"No?" he asks gently. "How's that, Rei?"

"It didn't— I wasn't—" I touch his chest. "All those things he did to me— when you do them, it— it doesn't feel like that. It feels— it makes m-me— it makes me feel good. When you touch me it feels good. When you hurt me it feels good. Please don't stop."

He tilts his head. "I don't understand. You were practically crying, you couldn't speak—"

"I don't— I don't know how to explain it. It's like pain. There's pain that feels bad, like stubbing your toe, but then there's pain that feels good, like you rubbing my back. I felt… raw and overwhelmed and it just— I felt so close to you—"



"You sure love being manhandled, don't you?"
