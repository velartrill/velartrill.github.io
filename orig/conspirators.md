With his cap and sun-spectacles on, Lena might almost pass for a short Kaparttu. I slip my feet into my sandals, watching idly as he kneels to lace his shoes. I can't help but admire the gentle curves of his body; the slim muscles under the dark tan of his skin. He looks up at me and smirks as I glance quickly away.

"Enjoying the view?" he asks.

"Where'd you even get shoes your size 'round here?" I ask him, desperate to change the subject. "Nab 'em off a Kapa midget, did you?"

"The magic of requisitions," he replies. "Cute sandals you got there."

"Thanks." I gaze fondly at the pair, flexing my toes. "Bought 'em at a market on Sapphire when I was seventeen. Only thing I have left of my homeworld, really."

He whistles. "They're sturdier than they look. They've lasted all those years?"

I nod. "Near on a dozen now. A bit dinged up but none the worse for wear. Back on Sapphire they make things to last."

He finishes lacing up and stands. His movements are so… easy and fluid; his body language practically screams confidence and power. "Do you miss Sapphire?"

I shrug. "It's just a place. Wasn't as though I had me a particular good life there, anyhow. What about you? You miss… wherever you came from?"

"Tel Listel." He smiles wistfully. "I do.  But I need to see this through, you know? It wouldn't feel right, going home and leaving a job unfinished."

I gaze at him appraisingly. "You sure that's all it is?"

He raises his eyebrows. "What do you mean?"

"What you told me about your unit — how many people left on Tel Listel do you actually still know, Lena?"

He's quiet for a moment, his gaze dropping. "Ah. Yeah."

"I ain't a soldier myself, but I've known 'em. I've worked with 'em." I step closer, touching him gently on the shoulder. "Some of them, the conscripts, they're just dyin' to do their time and get back home to their family. Some of them want to bring home slaves and spoils of war. But people who enlist outright — they have different stories."

"You think I'm running from something."

"There's three things’ as'll make a woman — or a man, I s'pose — choose to keep fightin’ when she's all alone and lost it all to war. There's anger, right. Your standard lust for vengeance, to get back at the  people who took your comrades from you. But you ain't a vengeful kind, I can see that in you plain.

"Then there's fear for the ones you love — knowing their lives rest on your shoulders. I reckon there's some of that still in you, but it's like you said; war's damn near done with. Sounds like Team Empress don't pose too much more a threat to your kind, with the bloodthirsty old biddy dead and Carnelian ash.

"There's something else, though." I look him in the eye, touching him gently on the cheek. "You been fighting this war since I was a girl. Twenty damn years of your life, give or take. It's most everything you know. That… that cohort of yours, that made up the Sixth— ain't many left to welcome you home, are there?"

Lena takes a deep, shaking breath. "You put all that together on you own, did you, Rhea-*virtash?"* he asks, eyes fixed on mine.

*"Virtash?"* I ask, blinking.

"Right. Uh…" He hesitates. "I don't know if you have a word for it. Someone who's trained to understand how the mind works, how *people* work. Back home everyone has a *virtash* they see now and again — they teach you to understand your own thoughts and feelings, and they help you heal when your mind is… wounded? Traumatized? They're sort of like… medics, but for the spirit, not the body. Is there a Zia Ţai word for that, do you know?"

I hesitate. "I… don't know. We got the priestesses, I suppose? Though their advice is as likely to be chickenshit as gold."

"…that explains a lot," Lena murmurs, his tone sympathetic.

"E-explains what?"

"You. Your culture. This whole fucking Empire-that-was." He laughs weakly. "Everyone is so driven by their basest emotions. Everyone is so damaged and they don't even know it. I just thought your *virtashar* were idiots, but turns out you don't even *have* them." He lets out a low whistle. "Yikes."

I narrow my eyes. "You think I'm *damaged,* do you?"

He laughs, putting a hand around the scruff of my neck and tugging me gently closer. "Rei, you are *so* damaged. Hey, don't give me that look — I'm not saying anything bad about you." He squeezes the back of my neck gently. "You've been through some bad things, by the sound of it, and you haven't had much in the way of support. I'm hoping that being with us will give you a chance to heal up a bit."

Something about his touch makes me go limp in his hands. Unable to pull away, unable to look away, unable to resist. The feeling of his hand on such a tender, intimate part of my body has set my heart pounding and rendered me mute. My limbs are trembling, my lips moving wordlessly. Lena gazes deep into my eyes for a moment, the intensity of his stare feeling like a white-hot blade through my spirit, and finally, he pulls me closer and hugs me tightly. Gratefully, I wrap my shaking arms around his back and bury my head in his shoulder. I can feel tears trickling down my cheek. Tears of what, I don't know.

I am so glad Vi isn't here to see this.

"Y'alright there, Rei?" Lena murmurs, a note of concern in his voice.

"I just… I'm—" I never want this to end. I never want to be freed from this soft, warm, powerful embrace, and I can't restrain a faint vocalization as he strokes the back of my neck with a hand. God alive, it's like I imprinted on him or something last night — I can't even think straight in his grip.

—Is this how Vi feels when I hold her?

"Shh. It's okay." Lena touches his cheek to mine. "We've got some time before we need to leave."

He holds me there in the foyer for a few long minutes, until some sense finally begins to reassert itself. Slowly, reluctantly, I pull away, flinching away from his gaze. "I'm— I'm sorry," I mumble; "I—"

"Hey. It's okay." Lena pats my shoulder. "See, when I say you're damaged, Rei? It's things like this. You put up a real good façade but it keeps cracking, and I keep seeing little glimpses of the woman you are deep down."

"D-do you now."

He laughs softly. "You're not the only one can read people. Hey. It's okay. We don't gotta talk about it now. I don't want to force you outta your comfort zone. Just… know that when you're ready to talk, or any time you need comfort, I'm here."

"Thank y-you," I mumble, cheeks burning.
