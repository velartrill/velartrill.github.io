# Once a Junkie, Always a Junkie
% by Lexi Summer Hale

"And you'll be paying for that, will you, missy?"

I roll my eyes at the barkeep. The credit clipper makes a loud *thunk* as I slam my chit into the slot. The burly man glances skeptically at the record-paper; I can see his eyes widen, and he looks back up at me — half amazed, half alarmed.

*"Seriously?"*

*"Seriously,"* I reply. "Can I have a fucking drink now?"

"…your wish is my command, missy," the man murmurs, backing away and grabbing a clean glass. A clean-ish glass, maybe.

I lean back on the barstool, slipping my credit chit back into my bag. Off to the side, a visibly drunken bard is belting out what sounds like an old fertility ballad, half the bar roaring along with him, nearly as loud as the man's own sound system. It's not helping my nerves much. The two drunken peacekeepers at the other end of the bar with their shiny brass medallions and long-barreled revolvers aren't either.

I grab the mug as soon as it clinks against the bar, throwing back a mouthful and wiping my lips with my wrist. The drink hits nice and fast,  its soothing warmth finally taking off the edge and making the bard's ballad a little bit more tolerable. The barkeep whistles.

"Missy can hold her drink, hey?" he remarks, amused.

"Shut it, old man." I glare at him, rubbing my temple and taking a more measured sip. A fresh pint of rotgut is the breakfast of champions. Especially when it's already past noon.

He ignores me. "What brings a girl like you out from up north? Somewhere like this, of all places?"

My brain short-circuits halfway between something caustic and something sincere. "Women," I mutter instead after a long pause.

"En't it always?" He cracks a grin. "You new in town, then?"

"…sort of yes, sort of no."

"Here to spend some money and make some bad decisions?"

"Does anyone come to Myraçan to make *good* decisions?"

He laughs. "Might do, but I'ven't met the one yet. You'll be liking another?"

I thrust the empty mug at him, wiping my lips with a wavering hand. "Please."

He takes it and disappears. I rest my forehead on my palm, closing my eyes and unbuttoning my vest. My blood is hot with cheap liquor, my head filling with a giddy sense of relief, and I feel a strange urge to join the revelers in their filthy song. *Good riddance. Good* fucking *riddance. Should have done this months ago. Finally I'm fucking* free. *Free to make my own way. My own choices. My own—*

"Now what's your story, lass?"

The voice is light and feminine. I open my eyes to see a girl sitting beside me, scarcely a year or two my elder. She's of Sara blood, by the look of her, tattered golden hair and ocean-blue eyes attesting to that. I can't help but be intrigued by the alluring scars on her cheeks and bare arms, the mischievous curl of her lips, her fetching messy complexion.

"Can't be so interesting as yours," I reply, turning my full attention to her. "Any chance some liquor might entice your pretty lips to spill the tale?

She giggles, leaning forward. "Oh, you're confident. I like that…"

Booze splatters my fingers as a full mug crashes down next to me. "Shove off, lass," the bartender growls at her. "This one en't for the taking."

I open my mouth to tell him to fuck off, but the girl beats me to it. "And what'd you know of that?" she retorts. "Your cock ain't been hard enough to take the loosest whore in years, old man."

"Trust me, Yna darling, this one *en't* worth the trouble. *Off* with you now."

Her eyes widen, and she gives me a frightened look before slipping off the stool and disappearing into the crowd. Slowly, I turn to the barkeep, furrowing my brow.

"The fuck was that about?"

"That? Oh, that was just little Yniskë." He laughs. "She's a flirt and a swindle. Can smell a broken heart at fifty paces."

I sigh, rubbing my eyes. "The 'wake up cuffed to the bed and bereft of all your valuables' sort?"

"That's the one. Valuables and maidenhood." He winks. I glare.

"Do I look like a fucking maiden to you?"

"Din't say a word, now, did I."

I shake my head. "Whatever. Thanks, I guess. She's the last kind of bullshit I needed right now."

"Oh, now, lassie, you en't the one I'm a-feared for."

I stare at him. _"…Ümêtan tabyr,_ you… were protecting *her?* From *me?"*

He taps the credit pad with an exaggerated whistle. "She's just a kid now, really. Making her way only way she knows." He glances up. "Doesn't need the kind of trouble *your* kind bring."

"The kind of—" I begin. Half-drowned in drink, my sense of danger takes that long to kick into high gear and the next moment I'm on my feet, traveling bag gripped tight to my side, aimed straight for the door.

The burly man standing directly behind me grabs me by the shoulder and waist, slamming me back down into my seat, sending a horrible jolt of pain coursing up my lower back. "Steady on now, lass," he leers as I grit my teeth, looming over me. "We was just looking to ask you a few questions. Ain't that right, Nakóra?"

"’Asright, boss." The woman standing next to him is an honest-to-Khata'e Rohara merc, with what look an awful lot like maelstrom gauntlets strapped around her lithe forearms. Even with the kind of company I keep, I've never even seen the like outside of sketches and ancient cameraworks. Her upper body is taut with understated muscle, and there's a coilgun holstered at her waist — a sleek, expensive one with a familiar icon engraved along the receiver. Above her deep pink irises, her dark brows crease cruelly and her lips twitch upward. I swallow hard.

He must be the brains, because she's *definitely* the brawn.

"The fuck do you want?" I ask the man, knowing full well the answer. I knew exactly how this would end the moment I laid eyes on his livery.

"Well now," the man responds, slapping me jovially on the shoulder. "I was just wondering — see, we're here about a girl. Seventeen years of age, mixed, long light hair, 'bout your height, in fact. You wouldn't happen to have… *seen* anyone like that around here, now, would you?"

"Nope. Definitely not. Bye." I push myself to my feet again; the big Khmai merc immediately shoves me back down, clicking his tongue.

"Check her, Naki," he rasps, yanking my bag off my lap and unzipping it. The woman grabs me by the arms, hauling me out of my seat and bending me roughly over the bar as she pats me down. I know better than to even try to fight back, but I can't help feeling slightly insulted that she barely even bothers to feel me up.

Nakóra clicks her tongue, yanking something off my waist, and I hear a blade snap open. "Oh, this is a naughty little knife," she leers. "I wonder what a cute li'l thing like you is doing with a knife like this?"

"My little old granny gave it to me," I spit. "S'for sawing cocks off donkeys." I grimace as she guffaws and slaps me on the rump before shoving me back into my seat.

"Anything?" the man asks. She shakes her head.

"Just the knife. You?"

_"Meir._ —wait, hang on. *There* we are." My heart is thumping in my ears as I watch him pull a little black leatherbound booklet from my bag.

"Is that—?"

"It is!" He guffaws, flicking the booklet open. "Oh, I fucking knew it. It's her, alright."

And that's it.

Now it's over.

"Errie, Errie, Errie," the man chides, snapping the booklet shut and leaning over to look me in the eye. "You've been a very naughty girl, Errie. You even went and cut your *hair,* Errie!" He snickers. "I wonder what the Storm will think of that?"

"Will you lovely folks be wanting any drinks to celebrate the occasion?" the barkeep asks from behind me. I scowl.

The merc shakes his head. "No, no, we're quite right. You just keep whatever little bribe she paid you to spike me drink, she'll answer for it soon enough."

A chortle from the barkeep. "She hadn't even, if you can believe it. Getting sloppy, is she?"

"…I was getting to it," I mumble, cheeks reddening.

"There's just no underestimating this girl." The merc tousles my hair mockingly. "Such a disappointment. Can't imagine why she's worth so much alive to anyone."

_"Khurushta mo mitile jushtu rukhami."_

The remark earns me a slap from Nakóra. "Someone still hasn't learned to respect her elders."

"That what this is about?" I glare at the two of them. "Gonna take me off and have me spanked 'til I call you sir and dame?"

"I bet you'd love to get off so easy," the man leers, handing Nakóra a pair of shackles, which she fits gleefully to my wrists.

Someone clears his throat behind the two. "Here, now — 'scuse me now, master; mistress."

Nakóra turns, and I catch sight of the peacekeepers from earlier. Apparently the altercation finally caught their attention. "Can I *help* you, sparky?" she asks icily.

The male peacekeeper clasps his hands in front of his waist. "Care to explain your business here, mistress?" he asks, indicating me with a nod. "You a lawful bounty on this woman here?"

Nakóra snickers. "'Lawful!' Ain't that the cutest." She steps aggressively forward, into the man’s personal space. "Push off and mind your own, sparky. This is Sŷralën business."

"But this ain't Sŷralën *land*, fallow-womb," the woman responds. "So I'll ask you again. Have you a lawful bounty over this girl, signed and sealed by a bailiff of North Coast Enforcement, or nay?"

"I'm gonna go with *fuck you, blank."* Nakóra makes what I can only assume is a crude gesture. "Don't make me get bloody, now. Not right before lunch. That ain't polite."

"Are you threatening an officer of the peace?" the other peacekeeper growls, his hand moving towards his gun.

Nakóra immediately lifts her hands and steel blurs in the air, glinting and flickering under the bar's low light. The next thing anyone knows, both officers are caged by a cloud of needle-sharp metal, each cutting edge trembling in the air where it's supported by some unseen power. The man yelps; his colleague swears aloud.

"You fight, you die." Nakóra looks them each in the eye, making a motion with her hands like she's crushing a pair of windpipes. "You call for backup, you die. You annoy me in the fucking slightest, you die. That fuckin' understood, *sparky?"*

"Don't, guys." I can't hide the weary resignation from my voice as I call out. "It's not worth it. You're not gonna stop them and I'm not worth getting yourselves killed over. Just let it go."

Nakóra beams, patting me roughly on the cheek. "Hear that, now? The voice of reason at last! You two just wait there nice and quiet, now, and I won't have to— *oops!"* The trembling female peacekepeer cries out, flinching sharply as a bright red line streaks across her cheek. Nakóra clicks her tongue. "Oh look at the silly fallow, being all *clumsy.* You best stand very still, now; no telling what her dim little brain might do next."

I've heard stories about people like her but seeing one in action is just *terrifying.* As she turns and winks at me it finally hits home just how completely I'm fucked.

The mercenaries lead me out into the square, where they have a massive goddamned tiltjet air-taxi waiting, at least six more mercs standing guard with rifles at the ready. How in fuck did I not hear *that* thing land? Was the bard seriously *that* fucking loud?

How much did all this fucking cost?

My cheeks burn as the mercs parade me, shackled, past the gathered crowd and drag me up the ramp into the jet. I'm shoved into a seat in the back, where Nakóra, taking no chances, locks my cuffs around a support column after she straps me in. "Don't I even get to enjoy the view?" I complain, which earns me both a slap *and* a blindfold. My cheeks red and stinging, I decide it's time to stop poking the wild _pien şai_ that could cut me to ribbons with a thought.

At least I've still plenty of drink in me.

The flight north is a short one after the scramjets kick in, and it's not long before I feel rough hands on my body again. The mercs don't bother to take off the blindfold before leading me down the ramp, leaving me to totter and stumble. Hearing their laughter this time is enough to start tears of humiliation and anger burning in the corner of my eyes, and by the time I'm shoved to my knees and the blindfold finally comes off, my nose is red and my eyes are drenched.

As I furiously try to blink them clear and they adjust to the light, the figure standing over me comes into focus. Striking blue eyes beneath long locks of rich, dark brown hair, streaked at each side with slim lines of black dye; delicate silk robes lovingly with embroidered with intricate floral patterns and flowing ocean scenes; a sleek sword fastened in its engraved sheath.

Above me stands the Lord of Opium. Oravdenel Sedvesêra, master of Sŷralën, kingpin of kingpins — indisputably the wealthiest, most powerful, most ruthless man in all of Saravan.

Not who I was expecting.

"Ëreńaskë, my dear!" Oravdenel exclaims, offering me his hand. "So good of you to drop in."

"…no trouble," I mumble, looking around blearily as he helps me to my feet and dismisses the mercenaries with an idle wave. We're in his study, amid the great rows of bookshelves I've spent so much time lost in.


"You had me *abducted* from an NCE _vareçta_ because you… you wanted my *advice?"*

"Well." Oravdenel straightens his robes, looking slightly put out. "What would you have done, sent a letter?"

"Yes! I would have sent a goddamn letter! Especially since you apparently knew where I was the whole time—"

Oravdenel clicks his tongue. "See," he interrupts, "this is exactly what happens when you're not around to talk some sense into me."

I just stare at him. This is the point where I'd probably start pulling out my hair, if it wasn't so short that the shackles on my wrists get in the way.

He gives me a grin and beckons me to follow him. "It's this business in the islands. "




"Could you please let me have these cuffs off?" I finally blurt, holding up my wrists pleadingly to Oravdenel. He favors me with a cruel smile.

"I think you'd best discuss that with the young mistress, dear," he says, and before I can say another word he's gone, the door shut and locked behind him.

Slowly, heart pounding, I force myself to turn.

And there she is.

Only a few paces behind me stands Sedyskë Dyteksehëstan herself. The Tempest of Sŷralën. Brutally beautiful. Ethereal, commanding, and totally ruthless. 19 years old and already half as feared as her father.

My ex.

"Hello, Errie," she says, in that voice like gravel and silk my heart knows so well.

My throat is too dry to speak. My legs are near paralyzed with… with I don't know what, and I can barely manage a few stumbling steps backwards as she approaches. Her sharp blue eyes take in every detail, fixed on my body like the gaze of a peregrine about to strike. "N-no…" I croak, raising my manacled hands protectively in front of me. "Please…"

"Shh." She advances on me, and I let out a startled yelp as my back runs up against the wall. She reaches out, pressing her palms flat on either side of me, caging me with her body, her lips inches from mine. I'm trembling like a leaf in the wind, and she takes a few moments to enjoy it before she finally, slowly, lifts up her hand and touches me ever so softly on the neck, setting loose a fearful little vocalization that forces its way out before I can choke it back. She looks so pleased at the little sound, her eyes brightening and her soft, thin lips curling upward. She reaches under my blouse, wrapping her delicate fingers around the curve of my thigh. Her other thumb curls around my windpipe, ready and waiting to take my breath away.

I've spent my life surrounded by power. I grew up in a city whose streets run with gold, whose army is mightier than whole nations. I've witnessed the wealthy change the world with the flick of their fingers, conjure up walls and towers, towns and orchards, railways and boulevards like it's nothing — like it's a game. I've seen…

I've seen so many things.

The sun's dying rays glinted along Ümêtan's horizon as she rose in the darkening sky, blotting out the stars with her sea of liquid smoke, lightning of the Everstorm flashing bright in her skies. We were sitting on the second-storey walkway, arms up against the railing and our legs hanging off into space. The air was rich with the scent of Sedyskë's burning cigarette and I was lost in her eyes, drunk on her voice as dazzled me with words I'd never heard before.

*I know you're broken. But that doesn't mean you need to change. Not just because some idiots don't get you.*

*I understand you, Errie. And I don't want you to change. You're perfect just like you are.*

It was the first night we ever spent together, back at that little apartment I shared with my mother on Çerasan Road. We talked about our lives, our dreams, my days spent in the opium fields. She laughed when I complained about the slumlords across the street, the long walk to the railway station, on the crowded, filthy road the coachmen let their _şue phin_ shit all over, and I saw her typing something on a handset — a sleek little mobile I could never have afforded in a hundred lifetimes. That was the first hint.

The second was the sounds of construction we woke to the next morning.

Hardly half a month was past when the rotting old tenements across the way were torn down, the street was ripped up, and a beautiful new streetcar was running all the way from Myçtaskên to Kirkelë, with a station right next to my home in the middle of a fresh-planted garden. And when I saw the new street signs along the brand-new boulevard, I couldn't believe my fucking eyes.

"Boulevard Ëreńa," they read.

"Who the fuck are you?" I asked her, half in fear and half in wonder, when she showed up unannounced on a bright summer morning.

She just smiled that smug little smile of hers and said, "let me show you."

And she made my dreams come true.

"Seventeen is when everything changes," my mother warned me sagely the evening before my birthday, over a dinner of steamed rice and reheated _heskerëçan,_ as we listened to the news on a tinny old radio — one of the old channels those pointy-eared socialists from down south used to run, back before the Man wised up and started shooting down their aerostats.

Mom couldn't have known how right she was going to be.

Oravdenel Sedvesêra isn't a king. He doesn't lead fleets on conquests among the stars, bringing home slaves, gems, and ancient technology in tribute. Nobody chants his name in the street, and his standard doesn't fly from parapets. He never talks about his ancestors, his divine right to rape and plunder — his blood is as common as any Sara's and he'd never want to hide it. He's a businessman, through and through.

He didn't conquer the world. He just bought it.

Since the day I took his daughter's hand, nothing has been the same. She dragged me up off the streets where mortals fight for the last few scraps of Creation's plundered glory, up into the clouds, into the world where the gods dwell, heedless of the petty struggles of the world below.

Surrounded by forces I can barely comprehend.

I've watched lives end at the barrel of a gun, but I've never once held one myself.


Oravdenel has little care or use for loyalty. On Saravan, mercenaries are a dime a dozen, and he likes his assets fluid and fungible. He calmly, bloodlessly hands down commands from on high and doesn't care who carries them out, nor if a thousand of his commandos die screaming in the doing. It'd just be a number to him. Just another number to jot down in his little notebook as he reclines in his favorite chair, puffing on a cigar and listening to his blood-soaked assassins recount their harrowing tales. It's all just business to him. Just an intellectual exercise. He'll show more emotion winning at a hand of cards than making half a billion sovereigns of pure profit.

Sedyskë's not like that. Sedyskë likes to get her hands dirty. She's a creature of passion, intensely physical. Business and pleasure are one and the same to her. She doesn't just want to win — she wants to earn her victory and feel it with every inch of her body. And she wants the people she beats to feel their loss just as deeply, wants to squeeze the last drop of defiance out of them with her own two hands. Slowly and intimately.

My mother told me stories about her people, when I was young. When my father's kind still had to hunt for a living, they did it like anyone else — they'd send their virile young men whooping and hollering off into the trees with spears and rifles to drag back a fresh *kuvjadva* or whatever for the tribe to feast on — but the ancient Khmai were different, mom once said. With the men away on boats or starships half the year to make trade with other nations, they'd capture birds of prey, falcons, kestrels, and sparrowhawks, and take them back to their women, who'd tame them and train them to hunt for the tribe. "Sometimes I wish I'd been born back in those days," she grumbled, fussing with a nearly dead lighter. "Rather go hunting with the birds than break my back harvesting opium all day."

The image was always so strange to me. How could you take such a powerful little being with its own two wings and fearsome talons, set it free into the air — and have it come fluttering back to you, talons soaked with some poor _pien şai's_ blood, to land on your outstretched wrist without so much as a peep of defiance? Why would a bird that never once needed humans, a bird that could fly anywhere in the world — a bird that had only to spread its wings to be free forever — come willingly back to be shackled and hooded and caged? It never made sense.

Not until the night late last winter I came crawling back to Sedyskë for the first time.

"I told father not to bring you back," she murmurs disapprovingly. "It would have been so much sweeter to watch you come crawling home to beg me on your knees again. Tch. He's always so impatient."

"I w-wasn't *going* to come back this time," I mumble, trying to look away, and as soon as I've said it I realize it's a lie. Sedyskë just laughs, and finally deigns to force her lips on mine. She doesn't even give me the chance to kiss her willingly. It's like she doesn't want my consent, like she *wants* me to fight, to take me struggling and screaming. I manage to drag in one last breath before her grip around my throat tightens. Her pureblood-blue eyes stare straight and unblinking into mine, drinking in the sight of my terrified squirming and choking for breath. Silently, tears begin to trickle down my cheeks.

When she finally pulls back and loosens her grip, the first thing that comes up out of my throat is a choked, broken sob. I can't fight it back anymore, can't keep myself from giving her exactly what I know she wants. My desperate gasps for breath intermingle with my anguished cries; my whole face is soaking wet. She caresses my trembling body with her hands and her voice as she unbuckles my belt, taking her time, savoring every moment of my fear and helplessness. Here, deep in her lair, there's no power in the universe that could free me from her grip — and we both know it.

My skirt falls to my ankles, leaving me half naked in the hands of an angry war goddess.

I know what comes next. I've known it since the moment I saw her beautiful face, and as her wrists close tight around mine the memories flash bright as a stun grenade inside my skull, leaving me momentarily catatonic. She lifts my hands high over my head, squeezing tight as she presses them against the wall. With the shackles binding my wrists so close together, she only needs one hand to restrain me, leaving the other one free. She strokes my cheek, still watching my eyes intently. 

They say once you're hooked on opium, you can never truly get clean. You can stop taking the drug, endure the week after week of tortorous withdrawal, throw away your pipes and flush your needles, but the hunger will always be with you, even if you never smoke another drop. There's nothing in Creation like that high that enraptures your soul even as it tears apart your body.

Not much, anyway.

She takes her time this time, slowly working up from gentle caresses and soft little nips to twists and tears and deep, penetrating bites. The shackles fastened tightly over my wrists leave her with a free hand to use against my body, a weakness she exploits ruthlessly, digging her thumb and forefinger into my breast, squeezing and twisting this way and that, eliciting uncontrollable squirming; humiliating, pained vocalizations force their way up my throat. She slips her hand inside my blouse, digging the sharpened points of her nails into the spots she knows I'm especially tender, first scratching, then ripping at my skin. The tearing point of her nails hurts worse than any serrated blade.

She leaves my cunt exposed for hours, drawing out my vulnerability and panic, before she finally deigns to violate it. If she's at all afflicted by the same appetites as lesser women, her self-control is something beyond the strength of iron. I've never once seen her take a girl without devoting hours to tenderizing her, teasing, tormenting, and terrorizing her with fingernails and knives and *teeth.* And sometimes implements besides. Sometimes she'll work a girl over til she's tattered and sobbing, then sit back and merely watch while her other partners finally deflower her victim, as if the act itself holds only some distant, clinical interest to her.

This time, however, she seems fixated. Her practiced fingers entice my body beyond my control, forcing me with excruciating slowness through the cycle of arousal and climax — all the more humiliating for how unwanted every last moment of it is. Her breathing is tense, rapid, excited as she presses up against me, and I can see her eyelids flutter when I squirm and tremble.

By the time she's finished, the last rays of sunlight beyond the great window are just disappearing under the waves — and I'm curled up on the cold floor, still shackled, gasping and moaning as the overwhelming, soul-shattering orgasm suffuses and violates my torn and tattered being.

After raping me up against the wall of the mansion's great observatory, she takes me by the hand and leads me, stumbling and half naked, through the hallways until we reach her chambers. There, she pushes me down onto the bed and finally releases my shackles — if only so she can pull my blouse off over my head and leave me finally naked in her arms. But she doesn't put the cuffs back on afterward.

She tugs back the sheets and lays flat on the bed, pulling me with her and tucking my head protectively under her chin. Tenderly, she squeezes and massages my whitened wrists until the color returns and the bite of the manacles can no longer be seen. Her warm touch feels so good that my arms go limp in her grasp.

Her keys rattle in the lock and she pushes back the door into her… our… bedroom. It's a study in minimalism and elegance, no gaudy ornaments fancy canopies, with a long, low bed flush up against the sea window. Sitting on the bed is another girl, naked except for a translucent silk cardigan around her shoulders, snuggled up into the pillows. She sits up as we enter, yawning and gazing at me with bright red eyes. Her hair and body are so dark, darker than anyone I've seen in ages. Zyahua are a rare sight this far north — I can see why she caught Sedyskë's attention.

"Aww. What a cute little thing," the girl murmurs gently in her thick, exotic accent, giving me a sleepily sultry smile. "She looks so good in handcuffs."

"Told you." Sedyskë grins at the girl. "Let's give her a proper welcome home, Falcon." She takes me by the wrist again, setting my heart pounding, but pulls out her keyring and finally, finally unlocks my cuffs — just so she can pull off my top and leave me completely naked in front of Falcon, who whistles appreciatively.

But at least Sedyskë doesn't put the cuffs back on.

She leads me to the bed, pushing me down on top of the silky-soft sheets and seating herself next to me. She gestures to Falcon, who obediently moves down by my legs, which she forces apart, gripping me around my thighs and giggling softly. Sedyskë covers my eyes with her palm, and I let out a mewl of distress as I feel Falcon's soft tongue in my still-tender cunt.

"Good *girl,"* Sedyskë tells her, slightly breaking my heart when I realize she's not talking to me. "Tell you what — every good noise you get out of her, I'll take a stroke out of your next morning flogging. How's that sound?"

"Thank you, mistress," comes Falcon's muffled voice. "Mmm, she has a *nice* tight cunt."

"Oh yes, not like yours at all." Sedyskë scratches me idly on the back of the neck, sighing happily as I squirm with pain and discomfort in her new partner's grip. This is cruel, even for her. How long is she going to keep torturing me before she just—

—before she just holds me again?

_Mitiku Khata'e,_ I just want her to hold me again.

"What do you think?" says Falcon. "Should we just keep doing her 'til she comes round and get her off again?"

"Hmm, I don't know." Sedyskë leans down, her hot, sweet breath on my face, her gaze drilling into me. "Would you like that, Errie, love?"

"P…please…" I beg. "P-please don't."

"No?" Her voicing is teasing, intrigued. "What do you want instead, Errie?"

"P-please h-h… please just… I just want t-to be held."

"Hmm." Sedyskë kisses me softly, no biting this time. "Alright, that's enough for now, Falcon." I give a gasp of relief as the girl pulls away, squeezing my legs together and rolling onto my side. Sedyskë tugs the covers up over my shoulder, tucks my head under her chin as she wraps her arms around me. I whimper a little as she forces her knee between my legs, resting her thigh snugly against my sore cunt and seizing me by the rear when I try to pull back. "Shh. Be good," she whispers, squeezing my ass, holding me against her leg. "I won't rub. Not right now. But you need to remember your place."

I bury my tear-stained face in her chest, and stop trying to move. She rubs my back, holds me tightly to her warm, soft body, and my muscles finally slacken. My arms, my legs, my chest — everything hurts so bad, especially my cunt, my every muscle is trembling like a leaf, but her warmth and her caresses fill me with this beautiful glow I haven't felt in… in so long.

I've wanted to feel this again for so long.

Falcon slips up on the other side of me, kissing me on the shoulder. Her soft, ample bosom presses up against my back as she pulls the blankets tight around us. She gives my neck a little nip, sending a shiver through my body, before she joins Sedyskë in caressing me, her long, slender fingers rubbing my thighs and massaging my chest. Between Sedyskë's slow, tight, enveloping motions and Falcon's light little pets and squeezes to my tits, I feel like I could just drift off into a blissful haze.

It's enough I can almost forgive Falcon for the half-hour she spent gleefully torturing me.

"Is this what you wanted, Errie love?" Sedyskë murmurs, and reluctantly I nod.

"It feels good, doesn't it? To have a caring lover to attend to your needs?"

I nod again.

"It must have really sucked, all the weeks on the run. All those weeks with cold beds and whores who didn't understand you. Weeks with weak, stupid people who could never give you what you need. I'll bet the hunger has been eating you alive."

I squeeze my eyes shut against the tears as her words hit home.

"I'll never abandon you, Errie. I'll never throw you out or give up on you. That's my promise. All you have to do is stay at my side, and you'll never have to go hungry again. I'll always be there to tend to you, to see to your needs, to protect you — and protect you from yourself. Keep you raw and bare, blissed out on touch in my tight grip. All you have to do is surrender."

"I…" I look up, barely able to meet her gaze. "I love you," I finally mumble, completely and totally broken. I hate myself so deeply, so furiously for saying those words.

But they're truer than anything I've ever known.

My girlfriend smiles, gently stroking my neck.

"I know, love," she whispers in my ear. "I know."


Sedyskë yet wears a leash, for all her power and family wealth. Her father, the sane, sensible businessman who built this empire still holds her reins. But even gods die, and when the spirit of Oravdenel Sedvesêra passes out into the stars, the fullness of his empire, his every scrap of power will be not just her allowance, but her inheritance. The passing of the temperate Lord of Opium will unleash a goddess, a being of raw, fiery passion and cruelty trained from birth in the ways of ruling and preternaturally able to dominate the wills of lesser beings such as I.

And when that goddess comes into her own, the only safe place in the universe will be at her side.
