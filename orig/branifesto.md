# contra the brassiere: a manifesto
% byline a deranged rant by lexi hale

I am generally, as the observant may have by means of highly sensitive scientific instruments already detected, an implacable enemy of the feminist cause and its pitiless [vagenda of manocide](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/ae5/16/e088afe667baefec7ad70307639f08f9.jpg), but I must confess that there are as yet a handful of niggling little issues where I myself cleave to the unreconstructed feminist position. For one, I suspect most feminists really are, in their heart of hearts, of the sincere and not entirely unreasoned belief that the sky — at least on sunlit days — is blue. Mountains too, even the most unrepentant feminists will doubtlessly concede, are generally somewhat tall. But even more striking is our shared attitude to *the bra,* a garment whose very existence and place in western culture I hold to be the product of a :vast[doubtless you will in short order find reason to locate the nexus of this conspiracy squarely in the hands of those whom you most devoutly abominate, be they capitalists, workers, the poor, Illuminati elites, socialist big business, reptoids, monarchists, ｍｉｃｒｏｃｈｉｐｓ, globalists, nationalists, communists, fascists, Methodists, blacks, whites, gays, straights, men, women, gun owners, Russia, China, Iran, America, sorcerers, systemic racists, islamophobes, vaccinophiles, vaccinophobes, vaccinocrats, Bill Gates, The Jews®, or perhaps — the likely true culprit — all of the above, and I can only wish you godspeed in this noble undertaking] and ruthless conspiracy against the female race, one which will fail to delight not a single rage-addicted doomscrolling Nth-wave vaginosupremacist narcissist in its gratifyingly infuriating misogyny. Fear not, however, for this is not just a tale that will reinforce the feminist perception of men as a hamartiogenic defect in nature, but also one that will leave any truly redpilled thinker howling with morbid amusement at *yet another* example of inane female groupthink that again *proves* our basic incapacity for critical thinking.

As recently as the seventies or eighties, doctors, seemingly sapient and thinking beings with literal MDs from actual medical schools (though presumably the great majority of them of the :penile persuasion[which as we all know renders one a detestable *untermensch* and the source of all spiritual and worldly evil, fit only to be exterminated once their regrettable reproductive functions can be suitably offshored]) used to tell women, straightfaced, that girdles were a biological necessity which we must wear in order to "hold our organs in place." It's one of those ideas (like the one that northerly Eurasian races need vitamin D supplements to thrive in our native lands, as our ancestors have been taking with their morning coffee since the days of the Mongols or the Vikings) that is farcically absurd if you think about it for a full three seconds and which has all the same been a source of great profit for various superfluous industries. To simultaneously acknowledge the biological and historical reality of human evolution and believe in such myths requires brain-breaking levels of doublethink. It's hardly impossible, it's a human specialty, in fact — but it's not healthy.
