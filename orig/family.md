“Can I talk to you about your sister?”

Half-asleep, Jasmine rolls over in bed. There's a troubled cast to Sashuan's eyes, which glitter likes gemstones in the peaceful, milky moonlight. “You know I was just teasing you, right?” Jasmine murmurs, stroking her lover’s thighs with a gentle hand.

“I know.” Sashuan turns toward her and kisses her softly. “It’s not about that.”

“Then what is it?”

“It’s…” Sashuan sighs. “It’s a little hard to explain. You know how I told about… about things like _racvol_ and _shanracvol?”_

Jasmine frowns. “Yeah?”

“Well. I’m no counselor, but psychology was part of my spy training.” She hesitates. “Have I ever told you about _ceshracvol?”_

Jasmine shakes her head sleepily. “Nuh-uh. That’s… what is that, uh… *alone trauma… reaction?”*

“Close.” Sashuan smiles at her. “It’s closer to *abandonment trauma reaction.* _Ceshvol_ for short. Um. I’m bringing it up because I think Rose has it.”

“W-what? Rosie?” Jasmine sits up in bed. “Why? What is it, exactly?”

“It’s… _ceshvol_ is complicated. It’s sort of a… progression of a brain dysfunction we call _cardin_, which is like… ugh, these terms are all so hard to translate.” She shakes her head. “Well, um. _Cardin_ is… we don’t understand _cardin_ and _ceshvol_ very well, but there was a girl back home I used to sleep with now and then who had _cardin_, and she always described it as being like her emotions were just way, way too amped up. Whatever she felt, she felt it really, really intensely — something that might upset you a little bit, like, I don’t know, breaking a dish, she’d do something like that and she’d just break down; sometimes she’d get suicidal. She’d blow up over little annoyances, start fights over nothing. But when she felt good things, the feeling was so strong it was like…” She shakes her head. “Like being high on opium, I guess.”

“That’s… huh.” Jasmine purses her lips. “Rosie… she told me something kind of similar once. And… yeah, she does kind of overreact a lot, but I guess I just thought… well. You know what she’s been through.”

“Yeah.” Sashuan exhales. “The thing that makes _cardin_ distinct is that you don’t just overreact to the bad things. You overreact to the good things too.”

“…like how she’s always so excited to see you.”

Sashuan nods. “Exactly. So that’s _cardin_ — _ceshvol_ is what happens when someone has _cardin_ already and ends up getting abandoned. Like, when someone who’s dug really deep into your life suddenly goes away and it’s like they take part of you with them.”

“…oh.”

“You see where I’m going with this.”

“Yeah.”

“The thing about _ceshvol_ is it makes loneliness hurt really, really badly. Worse than anything else. So when someone who has it makes a meaningful new connection, they imprint really strongly on the new person and want to spend all their time with her. Remember what your mom told you, that time she caught Rose crying in her room after we left?”

“After *you* left.”

Sashuan nods. “That’s… like I said, I’m no _virtash_, but that’s about as classic _ceshvol_ as it gets.”

Jasmine is silent for a moment. “So between… what happened to Dad… Mom spending most of Rosie’s life at work, and leaving her to look after the kids… then how Rosie lost a girlfriend *and* her boyfriend—” She lays back down, staring at the ceiling. “If… if you’re right, she must be hurting so badly.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of.” Sashuan purses her lips. “When you told me that thing about how she’s not eating… I mean, she’s got a handy justification for it and all, but it sounds to me like self harm. Or… or worse.”

“Oh," Jasmine says in a very small voice.

“So I just wanted to, I don’t know. Give you some context for why I’m spoiling her so much. I mean, I like her too, I genuinely enjoy spending time with her and I’m glad I *can* be there for her, but I know she’s in a bad place and I’m trying to do what I can to bring some light into her life.”

Jasmine nestles closer. “Thank you for telling me. Thanks for caring about my sis so much.”

“Of course, love.” Sashuan ruffles her hair. “She’s family, after all.”

“Most people just think she’s too needy. More trouble than she’s worth.”

Sashuan gives an exasperated sigh. “‘Worth.’ Ugh, that’s such a Zyahua thing to say. She’s a sweet person, she’s hurting, and I can help her be happy — why wouldn’t I?”

“Most people want something in return, I guess. More than she’s got.”

“Making someone that happy isn’t enough?” Sashuan replies incredulously. “How could someone see her face light up the way she does when I’m around and not want to keep doing that for her?"

Jasmine is quiet for a long moment.

"I don't know," she says finally.
