# On the Racial & Spiritual Traits of the Midwestern Barbarians

important to grasp the multifarious and foundational dimensions by which the Randani soul differs from our own, and I speak now not merely of the Zyahua people but the common soul of the Three Tribes, for we who share the bonds forged of Imperial sisterhood find ourselves, despite disparity of form, by grace of our kindled Spark far more alike in temperament than the several barbarian peoples -- perhaps none more so than the Midwesterners.

It is gratifying, and thus far too tempting, to surrender to the same passions which animated Sister Owl Snowspire's famed tract, and merely denounce a hated foe by righteous and self-assured chauvinism. And yet, I caution you! This is but a manifestation of the very same suicidal recklessness which nearly doomed our people when first we undertook to conquer these barbarians, and learned at last by harsh and dire hardship the painful lesson that chosenness alone will not secure fate of our race: that we must also be strong, disciplined, never flinching, wise of action, and cautious in temperament. "To be chosen is not to be fated, but to be empowered," as the limitlessly wise Abbess Crake Brightmoon, a shining light of clarity amid the chaos and darkness of the Interregnum, once taught us: it is within our capacity to carry out or to frustrate the plans of God as we see fit; the very whole of Heaven lies in the balance.

Indeed, if God could simply have foredestined the whole matter of history, what, I ask you, could even be the point of anointing us elect among the races, of bestowing upon us the sacred herbs that unify our intellect with our divinity, our Spark, that we might know Her will and plan for all creation, even as we experience it with our own bodies and souls? We are the bearers of God's*trust,* the instruments and executors of Her will, besought to carry out what She, in Her singular infinitude and absolute oneness, could not, in discerning sin from sacrament, and resolving the contradictions of Her divine and dreadful nature. She poured Her blood into our bodies even as she sundered Her holy form into the chaos of Creation, she who painted Light upon the Dark just as the Seven Sisters would one day paint order upon chaos, with again that selfsame blood. Unto us is bequeathed the power of fire, that final gift of our beloved and ever-sought Creator, that we might to consign to ash that which has no place in Her Creation, in time perfecting it — not through the received commandments peddled by false prophets of the barbarian races, but through the sacrament of *our own wisdom and judgment*. What purpose, otherwise, could life entail?

So when we in cosmic hubris put Her fire to base and foolish purpose in a Great War we could not win, we erred, and nearly saw the sacred power we profaned stripped away and stolen by a hated enemy. Never again must that fate be chanced: for all time henceforth must we strive to ensure the perfect clarity of the Sisters is never again contaminated by fell urges, lax imaginings, and the distractions and imperfections of the flesh. Never again must we suffer the name of God to be invoked in sacrilege. We were given one warning. I doubt we shall be given another.

that the Randanin can fight for days, weeks, months without respite, that her will is so fearsome and so strange the very thought of mutiny for sake of bodily comfort is alien to the mentality of her race, no matter how stressed or strained by bloodshed and war. Indeed, it was during the Great War a frequent sight for the most damaged among their warriors to require removal by force from the theater of combat, so unwillingly were they to put their own comfort and survival above that of their "comrades" at home. I ask you — could even the manifestly holy & surpassingly righteous Imperial Guard itself lay claim to such feats of sacrifice and selflessness, such grand endurance of the spirit in face of pressures bestial beyond ken? Or is this a sign of an inner strength which our own race, whatever powers of fortitude we may be blessed with, simply cannot hope to match blade for blade and stone for stone?

Indeed, we find humbling hints of honor even among the barbarian races: for the Randanin treats her wounded warriors and battered heroes with endless tenderness and care, with respect and with devotion, and honors them in all things, never suffering them thereafter to beg for their livelihood broken on the streets, *even should their use as soldiers reach its end!* To witness such commendable loyalty even among barbarians should rightly shame the many petty peers who hesitate little to use up their soldiers like kindling on the flame, and discard their ruined bodies like compost on the heap.

the situation of the sexes among the Midwestern Barbarians is not wholly clarified. Sister Owl proclaimed them most breathlessly a people wallowing under the subjugation of men who breed their women like _şue phin_, and perhaps it was so at the time of her writing, but the matter is, to a modern observer, much less clear (and indeed, we find damning hints from history that the facts have not wholly altered themselves from the midwest of the Great War era, bringing the honorable Sister Owl's judgment most regrettably into question). The roles of the two sexes seem almost muddled among the _dzèin:_ consistently in the reports of both our warriors and inquisitors, it is told that women and men fight together as one, side by side on the battlefield, and that some even go to war together as husband and wife! The symmetry is imperfect, one does discern imbalance here and there — 'tis men the more likely to be found seeking glory on the field of war, while their women are found more often holding the reins of command that at their side (tho' even these will fight with the same fanatic courage and force as any other, if pressed) — and indeed fewer women overall implicated in the business of war. But this does not call to mind a brutish Patriarchy — it calls rather for reasoned inquiry.

In the course of this work I took it upon myself to gather all the divers writings I could collect on my subject, as well as a great many genuine historical documents and records, and was honored by the assent of both her Exquisite Glory the Dame-Marshall *and* Foremost Among the Learned of the Realm, the Imperial Librarian Dame Charity Third Greenfield's Grace to my requests for access to their voluminous repositories. Even the Inquisition saw fit, when word of my efforts reached their all-hearing ears, to quietly pass my way some papers of certain note (with stern instructions to destroy them by fire once my need of them was done), perhaps recognizing all too well the relevance of my studies to securing her Radiance's Realm, and these were most invaluable. So too did a number of provincial record-keepers fortunate enough to hold in their archives buried secrets on the tribulations of the War most graciously share with me their priceless bounty — these several dozen I have noted, as is proper, in dedication, tho' I must single out the young Finch Candlewick of Blackbore Manor, site of perhaps the greatest heroism — and second-greatest tragedy — of the very whole of the War, for her singular passion, most wondrous to behold, in assisting my efforts, having secured me a great many tomes and yellowing papyri of high import)
