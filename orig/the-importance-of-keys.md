# The Importance of Keys
% by Lexi Summer Hale

My mistress was not, by any measure, a good woman, and I think she would have been the first to admit so. In the time we spent together I watched her extort innocent bureaucrats, shake down peers, blackmail courtiers, and on occasion get away with murder, without so much as a sliver of guilt in her eyes. But she was good to me all the same. She was not the stereotype of mistress who treats her apprentice as little more than property to be beaten until profitable — Kestrel cared truly for me, was generous with her fortunes when my family was in need, and made a sincere effort to teach me everything she knew. And one of the things she particularly strove to impress upon me was the importance of keys.

’Tis quiet enough I can hear the pins in the tumbler2 click into place. The lock turns and with effort I pull back the heavy steel door, wincing at the creak it makes. Automatic luminators spring to life, dimly illuminating a huge room filled with rows and rows of numbered lock-boxes. Fingering the master key on my ring, I set off down the corridor.

Power is a tricky thing. Not even we of the Privy Council can enforce our every whim upon the world, even if we may fancy otherwise from time to time — ’tis the sovereign alone to whom that privilege adheres, and that is the singular principle you must never forget if you wish to survive the deadly, fast-paced game of imperial politics. Many in high office make the mistake of thinking the power they wield belongs to them, and invariably learn of their error from the edge of the headsman’s axe. But Kestrel was wiser than that, and taught me many subtler weapons to wield. "No matter how silken your robe nor fancy your hat, never let yourself forget the art of common skullduggery, nor think yourself above it;" so went her mantra. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt so grateful for her tutelage as I do at this moment.

Number 12. I turn, heading down the row, keeping my eyes fixed on the box designations. My destination is halfway to the far wall, a black, sturdy safe just like all the others, two identifying Old Script characters painted carefully across across the the faceplate with a calligrapher’s brush. Into the slot I slide in the master key, a simple strip of metal engraved with the emblem of the Crown — the locks here operate on magnetic principles alone and are reputed to be unpickable. The barrel turns.

Having tasted real power, I understand the temptation of forgetfulness all too well. Intoxicated by the bowing and scraping of servants, the ease by which the strokes of my pen beget suffering and death, I could well have forgotten that the women and men who carry out my bidding do not serve *me* — and indeed would gladly throw me to the _pien şai_ if it bought them even the pettiest rise in station. I may wear a vizier’s robes, but I did not make myself vizier — the finely filigreed structure of Imperial power long predated my birth, and shall long survive my death. And while her Serene Radiance did deign to hand me the reins, the _şue phin_ I drive is not mine — and she is far from tame.

The articles I seek are within, each secured in a labeled cloth bag. I remove them one by one — a sleek, delicately forged sidearm; a few magazines of ammunition; a strange, boxy little mechanism that looks something like a farcaster; a camera; a metal slate of uncertain purpose; odds and ends besides — and stow them away in my satchel, filling up the evidence-bags with crumpled paper to conceal their emptiness. Finished, I relock the safe and head further down the row.

All power has a sovereign, Kestrel taught me. When you wield it in the name of that sovereign, it will flow easily and true, transforming a handful of words into an outpouring of force that will shake the foundation of worlds and alter the fate of nations. But when you try to wield power against its sovereign, it will revolt, kick and buck and spit until you are thrown from the saddle and trampled in the dirt by the same energies that you once thought yourself the master of.

Box 2267 is, per the registry, not yet assigned a case; ’tis meant to be empty. It is not. I collect the handful of documents, slips, and booklets I stowed within for safekeeping before I head back out of the vault. I peek cautiously out from behind the door to ensure the hallways are empty before I step out into the dim lighting of the evidence chamber, locking the vault behind me. One last task lies ahead, and a *cathartic* one at that.

The institutions that form the sinew of political might are designed for a specific purpose: their structure delineates how they can and cannot be used. To we who sit near the apex where that complex web of systems is knotted into one, their actual structure can become perilously opaque — too used are we to the convenience of secretaries and flunkies, whose thankless task it is to translate and transmit our words down that structure until they reach the common thugs who will finally carry them out. This is the trap that the powerful set for the disloyal, the danger that must be avoided if you have any design against your sovereign’s interests. ’Tis where you must resort to common skullduggery, and where you must wield only with surgical precision the power bestowed upon you. You must prevent it from rebellion by the simple expedient of convincing it that you are acting in accordance with your sovereign’s will — even when nothing could be further from the truth.

The offices of my subordinates are not nearly so well appointed as my own. This part of the building is full of little rooms for the little people, the secretaries, agents, and researchers who make up the bulk of the Office for Defense of the Throne — who do the actual work of defending that throne. I catch sight of one lit office, someone working late on a case, and duck my head as I pass her window.
Consider keys. It is not the way of the mighty to carry bulging keyrings about on our belts — that is left to the janitors, and other such petty servants as may be tasked with the inconvenience of procuring our access to what spaces we desire. But a servant is more than an simple, obedient automaton — she is a pair of watchful eyes, a witness in the making, a complex human being with her very own wants, needs, and loyalties. (Thus it is not merely dishonorable but also particularly unwise, Kestrel taught me, to be cruel to servants.) So too is a servant a kind of guardian — when there are no servants about and no eyes to watch for misdeeds, even the highest of mandarins is left impotent in the face of a single locked door.

I swallow hard as I stop in front of the next one, listening carefully for any sound of activity from the office that lies beyond. I press a small diviner-glass against the door’s peephole, the shape of its lens defying the optical trickery within and making a one-way conduit into a two-way aperture. I breathe a sigh of relief. Nobody waits on the other side of the door to foil my schemes; my keys rattle in the lock and then I enter.

Kestrel had a gainful habit of “collecting keys I shouldn’t have,” as she would describe it, and ’tis one I have dutifully continued in my own career. There is today no door nor vault in the Office whose doughty protections I cannot bypass. ’Twas startlingly easy to accomplish — keys are lost every day, and nobody thinks twice when some bureaucrat puts in an order for more spares. Spares delivered, of course, directly to my office, to ensure that no conniving underling might pilfer her way into the vaults. Such a simple illusion, and yet so potent.

The room inside is conspicuously tidy, all its contents impossibly clean and well-organized. It is exactly what you would expect the office of Starlark Moonhollow to look like, had you the misfortune to spend but a moment in her presence. I make haste to her desk, opening a drawer at the bottom and unloading a number of carefully selected items into it. A pair of gloves exactly matching those I now wear. A few select keys from my ring. A passbook with a photograph of her, but the name of another.

It is a somewhat desperate ploy and I am uncertain if it will buy me any time at all. But if fortune favors me tonight, I might castrate two _pien şai_ with but a single razor — deflect suspicion from my own shoulders for a time, and place its weight instead upon the most vexingly efficient and cunning of my subordinates. Mistress Moonhollow’s skill as a detective is second only to her fanatical devotion to the Tenth Empress, and it has been clear from the day I met her that she thirsts after my coveted seat on the Privy Council. Most direly of all, she is without a doubt the bloodhound who shall be set upon my scent if my treason is discovered and she is not properly neutralized. I have lain the best false trail I can, given the circumstances, but I doubt that it will fool a woman of her caliber for so much as half a moment.

I make my carefully back to my office, sneaking awkwardly past a number of night-guards — mine is not the body of a youthful spy, quick of foot and suited to such cloak-and-dagger derring-do, but one wracked by pregnancies and beset by the many aches and pains of advancing age. ’Tis with a sinking feeling that I realize how such frailty could well undo me.

Lishuen is sprawled out on my sofa when I return, clutching a pillow to her chest, which rises and falls in the slow, gentle rhythm of a sleeper’s breath. I seat myself on the table across from her, lean forward, and quietly whisper her name. Instantly she’s wide awake, scrambling to her feet, looking back and forth with terrified eyes as she tries to back away.

I catch her just before her legs give way, and she clings to me, breathing hard. “It’s alright,” I murmur. _“Iol dalo ve; pas seshe, pas seshe.”_

The sound of her native tongue seems to calm her. I help her back down to the sofa and quickly release her, stepping back to try and give her body the respect it has so long been denied. Slowly, hesitantly, she looks up at me. Her eyes and nose are red and dried tears blotch her cheeks.

“Do you know where you are?” I ask gently.

She takes a deep breath, nods.

“Were you having a nightmare?”

Another nod. “They… they had me again,” she says in a small voice.

“I— I am sorry.” I reach down for my satchel; she starts reflexively at the motion. “Might your feel any better with this at hand?” I inquire, retrieving her firearm and ammunition. Her eyes go wide and she grabs the weapon immediately.

“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she gushes, holding it tightly like it might leap from her grasp at any moment. With difficulty, she slots in a cartridge and wraps her hand around the grip; the status lamp on the back of the weapon immediately comes to life and she emits an exclamation I don’t understand, but the tone of her voice is one of relief.

She releases the gun and slips it under her pillow, giving me a grateful smile. I hold out the bag.

“I brought you some other things as well.”

She reaches in, and her face lights up as she pulls out the small grey metal slate from the evidence locker. “My laptop,” she murmurs, pressing her hand to the front and lifting the top away. It pivots upward like the cover of a book, revealing a panel full of small buttons, almost like a miniature keyboard. She presses one of them repeatedly, but nothing happens, and she sighs. “Battery’s dead. Shouldn’t be s-surprised. Fuck, I never thought I’d s-s-see this thing again.” She flashes me a little smile, putting it back in the bag. “I’ll figure out some way to charge it later. Thank you, I— I wasn’t sure you’d make it back.”

“I made you a promise, Lishue— Lishi,” I answer gently. “I wasn’t about to break it.”

She curls up in the corner of the sofa, laying back down and pulling the blanket back over herself. “H-have we long ’til sunri— ’til the workday starts, I mean?” she mumbles.

I nod. “Rest yourself, dear. We’ve some hours left. You are safe here for the moment, and it’ll be all the better if you can walk out of here on your own two feet.”

She exhales, nods. “Th-thank God. Okay.”

I give her a gentle smile. “I told you I had a plan.”

“Yeah.” She pulls the blanket tighter around her little body. “Could… could I have more water, please?”

“You have only to ask.” I rise from my perch on the low card-table. “I’ve also tea aplenty should you desire any.”

“Oh. That sounds good.” Her voice is sleepy, but she’s stuttering less. An encouraging sign. “D’you have any black saddleroot?”

“I most certainly do, it’s my favorite. Would you care for sugar?”
She smiles. “Two cubes, if that’s okay? It’s my favorite too.”

“I’ll heat some water right up.” I open up the compartment that so artfully conceals the tap and glassware from view, and press the switch at the base of the galvanic boiler. A lamp inside lights up and it starts hissing as it fills with bubbling water. I fill a cup at the tap and walk back to Lishuen, who sits up and takes it eagerly. I watch in silence as she downs nearly the entire cup in one go.

“When was the last time they gave you any water?” I ask softly.

She stares at the cup in her hands for a moment before answering. “I don’t… I don’t know. I don’t even know how long—” She stops abruptly and looks up at me. “How long was locked up for?” she blurts out. “You must know.”

“I don’t, but I can check. Would you like that?”

She nods. I stand again, wincing at the jolt of pain that shoots through my thighs as I do, and make my way over to my desk. I unclip my necklace and set the amulet into a slot on my teletype. The elegant brass-and-wood machine comes smoothly to life, lights spreading across its base and illuminating the keys. New Script runes glow beneath my fingers, and the print-head chatters to life. Out of habit, I reach out to tighten the cable at its base as the roll of paper starts to turn, lines of text scrolling past. Most of them are system messages meant for _tian bèi_ versed in the lore of machine spirits, but finally it prints three familiar lines and stops moving.

    GREETINGS, DAME RAVEN. I AM YOURS TO COMMAND.
    [ 0087 ] LETTERS & MEMORANDA AWAIT YOUR ATTENTION.
    - MAY THE EMPRESS REIGN TEN THOUSAND YEARS -

I set my fingers to the keyboard and begin tapping away. Lishuen watches in interest from the sofa as lines of text scroll past. “Is that… a _parcorvos?”_ she asks timidly. “I— I saw one in a museum once. But yours is so fancy.”

“Haven’t your people such machines?” I ask. She shakes her head.

“Oh, we stopped using them a long time ago. Like, centuries before the Great War I think.”

“What on Carnelian do you use instead?” I ask, my curiosity piqued. “Simple telegrams? Surely you must have some efficient manner of speaking to your computation engines.”

Lishuen shakes her head, pointing to the device with the miniature keyboard on the table. “We just use portables like that. They talk to each other on wireless. If I had power I could show you.”

I slip a copy-sheet into the feed tray and strike a key. The machine begins to chatter rapidly, slowly filling the sheet and scroll with Lishuen’s — or “Serenity’s” — detainee profile. “I’ve power sockets in the room,” I tell her, rising from my seat. “Would they suffice, do you think?”

“Maybe. Worth trying, if I can maybe get my things charged? Especially my handset.”

I move my chair over to the power cabinet and open it up. I walk back to Lishuen and offer her my arm. “Let me help you over?”

She nods, taking a deep breath. She feels steadier on her feet already as I guide her to the chair, if only just. I hand her the satchel as she sits and she extracts the bundle of wiring, along with a few other devices. She spends a few moments leaning over the power sockets and fiddling with cables before there’s a sharp *crack* and sparks fly. Lishuen lets out a frightened cry, pulling frantically away like a stung wild animal. The chair she’s sitting on nearly topples and I barely catch it in time.

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” I try to reassure her. “That happens all the—” I stop.
Lishuen is huddled in the chair, her legs pulled up in front of her body, breathing hard; tears glint in her eyes and she’s shaking like a leaf. She flinches as I step closer.

“Lishi?” I say quietly. She doesn’t respond. I hold out my hand and she recoils, terrified eyes fixed on me. ’Tis just the same expression as was on her face the moment of her waking— _“Seshenan tam, Lishi?”_ I ask in the gentlest voice I can muster. _“Riga shirenan? An rihes gan dalenan?”_

And again, whatever frightful state has come over her, something about speaking to her in Ranuir seems to break the spell. For a moment she seems confused, looking about wildly, and then suddenly she’s crying, her body wracked by full-force sobs. I kneel down and offer her my hand; she takes it, curling up in the chair.

“Whatever is the matter, dear?” I ask, squeezing her hand softly. She shakes her head violently.

_“Shosi shanvol. Shosi, shosi, shosi shanvol—”_

“Lishi, I… I don’t understand.”

“I was back there again. It was all happening again—”

“Lishuen, my dear, no, you weren’t; you were right here, all the time, I promise.”
“No, that’s not— I don’t—” She taps the side of her head. “In here. In here, it was all happening again. Fuck, why—” She digs her fingernails into her arm, shaking her head again. _“Ie, ie, sema veshes dusho vashes shar; pasit dusho vasho ie—”_

*Useless. Broken.* I can understand enough of the words she’s saying to know she’s cursing herself. Instinctively I grab her wrist, pulling her hand away; there’s already bloody marks on her arm. “Ssh, no, no, stop,” I try to tell her. “Don’t do that to yourself, don’t—”

I half expected her to yank away or attack me outright. Instead, the last thing I would have imagined happens and suddenly she’s crying in my arms. Instincts I’ve buried for decades suddenly rise up and the next thing I know I’m hugging her close, running a hand through her hair, automatically trying to comfort and calm her.

I don’t even remember the last time I held another human being.

I sit with her for a while, a blanket over our laps, my arms around her shoulders, her legs across mine. “It was the spark, wasn’t it,” I ask at length, and she nods wretchedly, squeezing her legs tightly together. I should never have left her there for as long as I did. I should have intervened sooner. Should have had some goddamn courage, chosen a side instead of vacillating for fortnights. 

’Tis all so much easier to deal with the knowledge that helpless women and men are being tortured daily under your authority when they’re just numbers and words on a page. So much easier to read bland, clinical intelligence reports than to see firsthand how their revelations are extracted.

“Let me fetch you your tea,” I murmur. “It should be ready by now.”

Steam rises from the cup as I press the switch on the heater and boiling water pours out of its tap. I load up the infusers from a little herb jar, just barely remembering Lishuen’s two sugar cubes as I fill the mugs. A thought occurs and I wet a rag under the water before carrying the mugs back to the sofa.

“May I tend to your wounds?” I ask Lishuen. “I fear I’ve no bandages but at least I might clean away the blood and dirt.

She swallows, nods. “Please just… please just be gentle.”

I set the mugs across from us, and seat myself next to the poor girl. I slip her arm free of her outer robes, and begin carefully wiping clean her many lacerations. She seems to react less now to my touch, though her muscles still tense with every stroke of the cloth. Halfway through I have to return to the faucet to wet another, so caked is the first in blood and grime.

The hot water on her skin seems to soothe her despite how badly it must hurt, and by the time I’ve finished both arms, the look of fear and pain on her face has somewhat diminished; her eyes are contentedly closed, the tiniest smile on her lips.

“Might I clean your cheeks as well?” I query, slowly and cautiously holding up a hand. “It will be easier to escape unnoticed if you do not look so battered.”
She looks away for a moment but then nods, resting her soft cheek in my open palm. She seems much more sensitive here; every brush and pat of the cloth begets another flinch, another wince, another small, pained vocalization. Up close, her wounds appear even more dire, and it almost would seem a miracle that none have festered. I know better, however, for ’tis part of the typical protocol to wet open wounds with alcohols and purifying agents, both as a means to ensure that no prisoner is rescued from our care us by an untimely death, and to greatly magnify the pain already inflicted.

“It’s— ahh— so warm in here,” she murmurs, as I wipe away a streak of blood just below her eye. “I don’t remember th-the last time I wasn’t shivering. I don’t remember the last time I was… allowed to wear clothes.” She glances out my office window, at the rain crashing down outside. “Is it cold out there?”

I nod. “I fear so. Be that as it may, I’ve a proper coat and boots for you;

What’s the plan after that?”

I rummage in the bag. “I have a small cache of false identities that I’ve been able to sneak into the system over the years. Including one with your mugshot. Ah, here." I pass her the little booklet. “If you dye your hair and wear dark enough spectacles, you should be able to pass for a Kaparttu as far as anyone’s concerned. Nobody expects to see a Green out on the street anyway.”

She takes the passbook, flips through it. “What about the Harmony system? There’s no card in here.”

I grimace. “Even I don’t have the power to subvert it. Anything we do requiring a Harmony rating has to happen before my real one is blacklisted.”

“What is your rating, anyway?”

“Forty-three, last I checked.”

She glances up at me. “That’s… lower than I expected.”

I sigh. “My grandparents immigrated from the Traverse. We’ve only had a few generations to build any social credit. Still, it’s enough for most purposes.”
