# The Importance of Keys
% by Lexi Summer Hale

My mistress was not, by any measure, a good woman, and I think she herself would not have hesitated to admit it. In the days we spent together I watched her extort innocent bureaucrats (if indeed there can be such a thing), shake down peers of the realm, blackmail courtiers, and on occasion get away with murder, without so much as a hint of guilt in her conniving rose-red eyes. She was capable of a bloodless, dispassionate ruthlessness I've not achieved upon even my darkest -- nor greatest -- day. But all the same, she was loyal to those who were loyal to her, nothing like the old stereotype one would readily assume. Her servants were her friends and confidantes, not her slaves, nor I was some mere chattel to be beaten ’til profitable. Kestrel, I think, the lonely, aging woman that she was, saw me as the daughter she never had, and never could have. She showered me with kindness, was endlessly generous with her wealth when I or my family was in need, sought my advancement even at her own expense, and made every effort to teach me truly all she knew. Her dirty tricks, her enviable collection of blackmail, her explosive secrets, her fine penmanship, her finer yet command of language—

—and the importance of keys.

’Tis quiet enough in the deserted office I can hear the tumbler's pins click into place. The lock turns and with effort I slide open the heavy steel door, wincing at the creak it makes. Automatic luminators spring to life, dimly illuminating a huge room filled with rows upon rows of heavy, numbered lock-boxes. Fingering the master key on my ring, I set off down the corridor.

Power is a tricky thing. Not even we of the Privy Council can enforce our every whim upon the world, even if we may fancy so from time to time — ’tis the sovereign alone to whom that privilege adheres, and she who forgets this singular principle will be hard-pressed to survive the deadly, fast-paced game of courtly politics. Many in high office make the arrogant mistake of thinking the power they wield *belongs* to them, of thinking it earned rather than given -- and invariably they learn of their error from the blade of the headswoman’s axe. But Kestrel was a wiser woman than that, and taught me many subtler weapons to wield than a demanding, pompous voice. "No matter how silken your robe nor fancy your hat, never let yourself forget the art of common skullduggery, nor think yourself above it;" so went her mantra. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt so grateful for her years of patient tutelage as I do at this moment.

Row 12. I turn, heading down the row, keeping my eyes fixed on the box designations. My destination is halfway to the far wall, a black, sturdy safe just like all the others, two identifying Old Script characters painted carefully across the the faceplate with a calligrapher’s brush. Into the slot I slide in the master key, a simple strip of metal engraved with the emblem of the Crown, looking more like an ornament than anything else — the locks here operate on magnetic principles alone, and are reputed to be unpickable. The barrel turns.

Having tasted real power, I understand the temptation of forgetfulness all too well. Ever intoxicated by the bowing and scraping of servants, the ease by which the strokes of my pen become strokes of the lash, I could well have forgotten that the women and men who carry out my bidding do not serve *me* — and indeed would gladly throw me to the _pien şai_ if it bought them even the pettiest rise in station. I may wear a vizier’s robes, but they are loaned at heavy interest, not fashioned by my own hands. The finely filigreed structure of Imperial power long predated my birth, and shall doubtless long survive my death. And while her Serene Radiance did deign to permit me a hand upon the reins, the _şue phin_ I ride is not mine to drive where I wish… and she is far from tame.

The articles I seek are within the safe, each secured in a labeled cloth bag. I remove them one by one — a sleek, delicately forged sidearm whose simple elegance and eerily perfect symmetry would bring even a master gunsmith to tears; a few magazines of ammunition; a strange, boxy little mechanism that looks almost like a farcaster in miniature; a galvanic camera, smaller than any other I've seen; a glass-and-metal slate of uncertain purpose; odds and ends besides — and stow them away in my satchel, filling up the evidence-bags with crumpled paper to conceal their emptiness from a casual glance. Finished, I relock the safe and set off further down the row.

All power flows from a sovereign, Kestrel taught me. When you wield the power of a great sovereign in accordance with her will, it will flow easily and true, effortlessly solidfying a handful of words into a spear of godlike force that will strike far across heaven, shatter the foundation of worlds and alter the fate of nations. But when you try to wield that power against its own sovereign, it will revolt, kick and buck and spit until you are thrown from the saddle and trampled in the dirt by the same energies that you once unwisely fancied yourself the master of.

Box 2267 is, per the registry, not yet assigned a case; ’tis meant to be empty. It is not so. I collect the handful of documents, slips, and booklets I stowed within for safekeeping before I head back out of the vault. I peek cautiously out from behind the door to ensure the hallways are empty before I step out into the dim lighting of the evidence chamber, locking the vault behind me. One last task lies ahead — but a cathartic one.

The institutions that form the sinew of political might are designed for a specific purpose: their structure delineates how they can and cannot be used. To we who sit near the apex where that complex web of ecosystems is knotted into one, their actual structure can become perilously opaque — too used are we to the convenience of secretaries and flunkies, whose thankless task it is to translate and transmit our will down the veins and arteries of that voluminous hierarchy until it reaches the common thugs who will finally carry it out. This is the trap that the powerful set for the disloyal, the tripwire that must be avoided if you've any design against your sovereign’s interest. ’Tis where you must resort again to common skullduggery, and where you must wield only with surgical precision the power bestowed upon you. You must prevent it from rebellion by the simple expedient of convincing it that you are acting in accordance with your sovereign’s will — even when nothing could be further from the truth.

The offices of my subordinates are not nearly so well appointed as my own. This part of the complex is full of little rooms for the little people, the secretaries, agents, and researchers who make up the bulk of the Office for Defense of the Throne — the ones who do the actual work of defending that throne. I catch sight of one lit office, someone working late on a case, and duck my head as I pass her window.

Consider keys. It is not the way of the mighty to carry bulging keyrings about on our belts — that is left to the janitors, and such other petty servants as may be tasked with the inconvenience of procuring our access to what spaces we desire. But a servant is more than a simple, obedient automaton — she is a pair of watchful eyes, a witness always in the making, a complex human being with her very own wants, needs, and loyalties. (Thus it is not merely dishonorable but also particularly unwise, Kestrel taught me, to be cruel to servants.) So too is a servant a kind of guardian — when there are no servants about and no eyes to watch for misdeeds, even the highest of mandarins is left impotent in the face of a single locked door.

I swallow hard as I stop in front of the next one, listening carefully for any sound of activity from the office that lies beyond. I press a small diviner-glass against the door’s peephole, the shape of its lens defying the optical trickery within and making a one-way conduit into a two-way aperture. I breathe a sigh of relief. Nobody waits on the other side of the door to foil my schemes; my keys rattle in the lock and then I enter.

Kestrel had a gainful habit of “collecting keys I shouldn’t have,” as she would describe it, and ’tis one I have dutifully kept up in my own career. There is today no door nor vault in the Office whose doughty armors I cannot bypass. The ease with which I accomplished such a feat would startle you — keys are lost every day, and nobody thinks twice when a bureaucrat puts in an order for spares. Spares delivered, of course, directly to her office, to ensure that no conniving underling might pilfer her way into the vaults.

The room inside is conspicuously tidy, all its contents impossibly clean and well-organized. It is exactly what you would expect the office of Starlark Moonhollow to look like, had you the misfortune to spend but a moment in her presence. I make haste to her desk, opening a drawer at the bottom and placing within a number of carefully selected items. A pair of gloves exactly matching those I now wear. A few select keys from my ring. A passbook with a photograph of her, but the name of another.

It is a somewhat desperate ploy and I am uncertain if it will buy me any time at all. But if fortune favors me tonight, I might castrate two _pien şai_ with but a single razor — deflect suspicion from my own shoulders for a time, and place its weight instead upon the most vexingly efficient and cunning of my subordinates. Mistress Moonhollow’s skill as a detective is second only to her fanatical devotion to the Tenth Empress, and it has been clear from the day I met her that she thirsts after my coveted seat on the Privy Council. Most direly of all, she is without a doubt the bloodhound who shall be set upon my scent if my treason is discovered — as it doubtless soon shall be — and she is not properly neutralized. I have lain the best false trail I can, given the circumstances, but I doubt that it will fool a woman of her caliber for so much as half a moment.

I make my way carefully back to my office, sneaking awkwardly past a number of night-guards. Mine is not the body of a youthful spy, quick of foot and suited to such cloak-and-dagger derring-do, but one wracked by disastrous pregnancies and beset by the many aches and pains of advancing age. ’Tis with a sinking feeling that I realize how such frailty could well undo me.

Lishuen is sprawled out on my sofa when I return, clutching a pillow to her chest, which rises and falls in the slow, gentle rhythm of a sleeper’s breath. I seat myself on the table across from her, lean forward, and quietly whisper her name. Instantly she’s wide awake, scrambling to her feet, looking back and forth with terrified eyes as she tries to back away.

I catch her just before her legs give way, and she clings to me, breathing hard. “It’s alright,” I murmur. _“Iol dalo ve; seshe pas, seshe pas.”_

The sound of her native tongue seems to calm her. I help her back down to the sofa and quickly release her, stepping back to try and show her body the respect it has so long been denied. Slowly, hesitantly, she looks up at me. Her eyes and nose are red, and dried tears blotch her cheeks.

“Do you know where you are?” I ask gently.

She inhales, nods.

“Were you having a nightmare?”

Another nod. “They… they had me again,” she mumbles in a small voice.

“I— I am sorry.” I reach down for my satchel; she starts reflexively at the motion. “Might you feel better at ease with this at hand?” I inquire, retrieving her firearm and ammunition. Her eyes go wide and she seizes the weapon immediately.

“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she gushes, holding it tightly like it might leap from her grasp at any moment. With difficulty, she slots in a magazine and wraps her hand around the grip; the status lamp on the back of the weapon immediately comes to life and she emits an exclamation I don’t understand, but the tone of her voice is one of relief.

She releases the gun and slips it under her pillow, giving me a grateful smile. I hold out the bag.

“I brought you some other things as well.”

She reaches in, and her face lights up as she pulls out the small grey metal slate from the evidence locker. “My _sortal_,” she murmurs, pressing her hand to the front and lifting the top away. It pivots upward like the cover of a codex, revealing a panel full of small buttons, almost like a miniature keyboard. She presses one of them repeatedly, but nothing happens, and she sighs. “Battery’s dead. Figures. Fuck, I never thought I’d s-s-see this thing again.” She flashes me a little smile, putting it back in the bag. “I’ll figure out some way to charge it later. Thank you, I— I wasn’t sure you’d make it back.”

“I made you a promise, Lishue— Lishi,” I answer gently. “I wasn’t about to break it.”

She curls up in the corner of the sofa, laying back down and pulling the blanket back over herself. “H-have we long ’til sunri— ’til the workday starts, I mean?” she mumbles.

I nod. “Rest yourself, dear. We’ve yet some hours left 'til the moon is at its height. You are safe here for the moment, and it’ll be all the better if you can walk out of here on your own two feet.”

She exhales, nods. “Th-thank God. Okay.”

I give her a gentle smile. “I told you I had a plan.”

“Yeah.” She pulls the blanket tighter around her little body. “Could… could I have more water, please?” she asks timidly, as if afraid the request will provoke a blow.

“You have only to ask.” I rise from my perch on the low card-table. “I’ve also tea aplenty should you desire any.”

“Oh! Thank you!” Her voice is sleepy and weak, but she’s stuttering less. An encouraging sign. “D’you have any black saddleroot?”

“I most certainly do, it’s my favorite tea. And I have the *good* kind, not that brittle, sour hydroponic garbage the herbalists carry. One of the other viziers and I import it from the *Sacred Blossom* greenlands; they grow it the old fashioned way there, or so ’tis said. Would you care for sugar?”

She looks up at me, a fragile smile on her dry, wounded lips. “Two cubes, if that’s okay?” More quietly, she adds, “It’s… it’s my favorite too.”

“I’ll heat some water right up.” I open up the wall compartment that so artfully conceals the tap and glassware from view, and press the switch at the base of my galvanic boiler. Any old-money courtier would be appalled by the flagrant disrespect for tradition and ritual, particularly in front of a guest, which is precisely why I keep the thing hidden away — but from my present company I doubt I need fear judgment for my uncultured, plebeian ways.

A lamp lights up inside the boiler and it starts hissing as it fills with bubbling water. I fill a cup at the tap and walk back to Lishuen, who sits up and takes it eagerly. I watch in silence as she downs nearly the entire cup in one go.

“When was the last time they gave you any water?” I ask softly.

She stares at the cup in her hands for a long moment before answering. “I don’t… I don’t know, I— I don’t even know how long—” She stops abruptly and looks up at me, eyes wide. “H-how long was I imprisoned?” she blurts out. “You must know.”

“I don’t,” I reply apologetically, “but I can check. Would you like that?”

She nods. I stand again, wincing at the jolt of pain that courses through my thighs as I do, and make my way over to my desk. I unclip my necklace and set the amulet into a slot on the spirit-'writer. The elegant brass-and-wood machine comes smoothly to life, lights spreading across its base and illuminating the keys from beneath. New Script runes glow beneath my fingers, and the print-head chatters to life. Out of habit, I reach out to tighten the feed cable at its base as the roll of control tape starts to turn, lines of text scrolling past. Most of it is an inscrutable, intimate litany meant for _tian bèi_ versed in the arcane lore of the machine-spirits, but finally it prints a sequence of familiar lines and ceases to move.

    GREETINGS, **DAME RAVEN**. I AM YOURS TO COMMAND.
    **[ 0087 ]** LETTERS & MEMORANDA AWAIT YOUR ATTENTION.
    - MAY THE EMPRESS REIGN TEN THOUSAND YEARS -

I set my fingers to the keyboard and begin to key in commands. Lishuen watches me from the sofa as lines of text scroll past. “Is that… a _parcorvos?”_ she asks timidly. "Is there power in here? Somewhere I… I could charge my things, m-maybe…?"

“I’ve a cabinet with feed-endings,” I tell her. “Might they suffice for your purposes?”

“M-maybe? I… I don't know. I'm sorry. Um. May… may I try? If— if I can get my handset working again—”

"By all means, then. Permit  me but a moment." I find the entry I want and strike a key. The machine begins to chatter rapidly, switching from the little feed-tape to its parchment tray, printing out Lishuen’s — or “Serenity’s” — detainee profile in the cold, sharp, sensible letters of the New Script, so unlike the fluid, intricate glyphs of the Old I so greatly prefer. While it prints, I move my chair over to the feed-shrine in the wall, which I unlock and slide carefully open, wary of disjoining my typewriter from its communion with the distant thought-engines of the palace. “Let me help you over?” I ask, turning to Lishuen.

She nods, taking a deep breath. She feels steadier on her feet already as I guide her to the chair, if only just. I hand her the satchel as she sits and she extracts the bundle of wiring, along with a few other devices. She spends a few moments leaning over the communion feeds and fiddling with lines before there’s a sharp *crack* of displeasure and an angry white light briefly illuminates her. Lishuen lets out a frightened cry, pulling away like a stung wild animal. The chair she’s sitting on nearly topples and I barely catch it in time.

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” I try to reassure her. “The spirits here are cantankerous; it happens all the—” I stop.

Lishuen is huddled in the chair, her legs pulled up in front of her body, arms slack, breathing hard; tears glint in her eyes and she’s shaking like a leaf. She flinches as I step closer. _"Ve, ve, ve,"_ she whispers, staring up at me in fear. "Please, *please,* God, no, please—"

“Lishi?” I say quietly. She doesn’t respond. I hold out my hand and she recoils, terrified eyes fixed on me. ’Tis just the same expression she wore the moment of her waking; she seems delirious, as though lost in a fearful waking dream. _“Seshenan tam, Lishi?”_ I ask in the gentlest voice I can muster. _“Riga shirenan? An rihve gan dalenan?”_

And again, whatever frightful state has come over her, something about speaking to her in Ranuir seems to shatter the spell. For a moment she seems confused, looking about wildly, and then suddenly she’s crying, her body wracked by full-force sobs. I kneel down and offer her my hand; she takes it, curling up in the chair.

“Whatever is the matter, dear?” I ask, squeezing her hand softly. "Do you fear the spirits so?" She shakes her head violently.

_“Racvol shosi. Shosi, shosi, shosi risracvol—”_

“Lishi, I… I’m sorry, I don’t know what that means.”

“I was back there again. It was all happening again—”

“Lishuen, my dear, no, you were nothing of the sort; you were right here, all the time, I promise.”

“No, that’s not— I don’t—” She taps the side of her head. “In here. In here, it was all happening again. Fuck, why—” She digs her fingernails into her arm, shaking her head again. _“Ie, ie, sema veshve shar dushe; pasai dusho ie—”_

*Useless. Broken.* I can understand enough of the words she’s saying to know she’s cursing herself. Instinctively I grab her wrist, pulling her hand away; there’s already bloody marks on her arm. “Ssh, no, no, stop,” I try to tell her. “Don’t do that to yourself, don’t—”

I half expected her to yank away or attack me outright. Instead, the last thing I would have imagined happens and suddenly she’s crying in my arms. The transformation is startling: one moment, fearful of the lightest touch; the next, clinging to me for dear life. Instincts that have lain unused for decades suddenly take control and the next thing I know I’m hugging her close, running a hand through her hair, automatically trying to comfort and calm her. “Please,” she begs, voice cracking, “please don’t l-let me go.”

“Shh.” I gently massage the back of her neck, and she rests her head on my shoulder. "I won't. I promise."

I don’t even remember the last time I held another human being.

I help her back to the sofa and sit with her for a while, a blanket over our laps, my arms around her shoulders. I notice that she's squeezing her legs tightly together, and as realization dawns I can't help but flinch. It was not the agitated spirit she feared. Little wonder a spark like that would terrify her so fearsomely.

I know, at an intellectual level, that there was no other way this could have happened. It was a miracle I managed to put all the pieces together as quickly as I did, and had I acted sooner to free her it would have doubtless have accomplished little beyond paving our road to the pyre. Her suffering wasn't in vain — it bought us both a solid chance of escape.

And, I… I had to know.

I had to see firsthand that she truly believed. That she was truly willing to suffer selflessly for her people. There was no other way for me to be certain my schemes would have a better outcome than simply trading one wicked mistress for another.

I still can't help but hate myself for allowing her to be so direly mistreated, for so long. All those nights I rested comfortably in soft, warm beds, while she…

’Tis much easier to cope with the knowledge that helpless women and men are being tortured daily in your name when they’re just names on a page. Names, numbers, and lists of offenses. So much easier to read bland, clinical intelligence reports than to see firsthand how their revelations are extracted. So much easier to set my seal to a pile of death certificates than to witness those deaths brought about.

“Let me fetch you your tea,” I murmur. “It should be ready by now.” I squeeze her hand tightly as I get to my feet. She lets out an involuntary, heartbreaking little mewl as I let go.

I fill a cup with boiling water from the kettle, kicking up a small, warm cloud of steam. I load up the infusers from a little herb jar, just barely remembering Lishuen’s two sugar cubes. A thought occurs and I wet a rag under the water before carrying the mugs back to the sofa.

“May I tend to your wounds?” I ask Lishuen. “I fear I’ve no bandages but at least I might clean away the blood and dirt.”

She swallows, nods. “Please just… please be gentle.”

I set the mugs across from us, and seat myself next to the poor girl. I take her arm in my hands, glancing up at her as I do. The touch elicits the briefest pained little smile, and she shivers as I slip her arm out of her outer robe. Taking pains to show her the utmost tenderness and care, I dab and brush the cloth along her many lacerations, slowly wiping away fortnights of accumulated blood and grime. Underneath it all her skin is a deep, freckled tan, enviably smooth and soft. She seems to react less now to my touch, though her muscles still tense with every stroke of the cloth. Halfway through I have to return to the faucet to wet another, so bloodied and filthy is the first. I make certain to pitch the used cloth from the window on my way back -- sooner or later, my office *will* be searched.

The hot water on her skin seems almost to soothe her, despite how badly it must hurt. By the time I’ve finished cleaning both her arms, the look of fear and pain on her face has somewhat diminished. Her emerald eyes are contentedly closed, the tiniest smile on her lips.

“Might I wash your face as well?” I inquire, slowly and cautiously holding up a hand. “It will be easier to escape unnoticed if you do not look so battered.”

She looks away for a moment but then nods, resting her soft cheek in my open palm. She seems much more sensitive here; every brush and pat of the cloth begets another flinch, another wince, another small, pained vocalization. I run my fingers through her hair as I clean her cheeks, gathering it behind her ears to keep it out of the way — and take a sharp breath as I catch sight of what was hidden beneath her long, scraggly locks.

From the moment I first laid eyes on her, the girl seemed so… normal, so plain, so human. She's shown no preternatural feats of might, nor speed, nor reflex; strange though her color might be, it is no stranger than the dark grey skin and brilliant white hair of the Khmai, nor the Kaparttu with their radiant golden irises, nor the eerie slimness of the Void-dwelling Nikeri whose piracy and slavetaking terrorise the Rim. But this — this queer mutation is unlike anything I have ever seen in a human body. So minuscule, and yet so strange: where the helix of my own ears is blunt and round, hers tapers up to a soft, elegant point, almost like the tip of a leaf, and so utterly unlike any other of Haven's diverse and numerous races. So… alien.

I am suddenly reminded of the docile, friendly hounds so many women of the City keep as pets. Reminded of the fierce, feral sabrewolf stock whence they descend. So similar in body but for the wolf's majestic coat, proof against the cold and snow; her long, piercing fangs, ready to tear into unwary _pien şai_ — and her sharp, pointed ears, always alert for the sounds of prey.

What in Haven have I gotten myself into?

Up close, Lishuen's wounds look dire, and it almost would seem a miracle that none have yet festered. I know better, however, for ’tis part of the interrogator's protocol to wet open wounds with alcohols and purifying agents, as a means to ensure that no prisoner is rescued from our care by an untimely death — and to greatly magnify the pain already inflicted.

I gaze into her green eyes as they flutter open again for a moment. They're so… so gentle, so timid, so… frightened. Human or not, she is, in this moment, fragile and vulnerable, lost in a world with more predators than prey. The drive to protect her that wells up in my heart is one I have not felt in many a year, but its ferocity is all the more overpowering for its strangeness.

“It’s— ahh— so warm in here,” she murmurs, as I wipe away a streak of blood just below her eye. “I don’t remember th-the last time I wasn’t shivering. I don’t remember the last time I was… was…” Her voice falters, and she looks away, tears welling up again. “…a-allowed to wear clothes,” she finishes with difficulty, humiliated. She glances out my office window, at the rain crashing down outside. “Is… God, i-is it cold out there?”

I nod. “I fear so. Be that as it may, I’ve a proper coat and boots for you; and the train to the mainland is well heated.”

She swallows, nods. "Th-thank you." She looks up at me. "If… if this is Carnelian, that means… we have an embassy here, don't we? Envoys from the People?"

I was expecting this. I nod. "I know you must wish desperately to be among your own kind again, but the security ’round the embassy complex is simply too tight. It's under the watch of the Imperial Guard itself. If we were to go within sight of it we should both be undone."

She nods. "I… I figured, but… if I can get my radio handset working…" She gazes out the window. "Maybe we could get close enough to get word. To let them know I'm…" Fresh tears well up in her eye. "…alive," she mumbles. "Trying to… to come home. They might still be able to help. And… my friends, my… the people I love…" She shakes her head violently. "I don't want them to think I'm gone." Her voice cracks and she buries her head in a pillow.

I gaze at her, calculations rushing through my mind. "How close would you need to get?" I murmur. "The complex is in the Forbidden City. It's a district to itself, closely guarded, but if we need not approach the walls…"

"I… I think… half a league, maybe, at maximum power. If it's not damaged. And depending on the terrain…"

I exhale. "It may be possible. We can strategize when we're safely quit of this place, however."

She looks up at me. "Where are we going?"

"I've a retreat up in Clarity Vale, nearly twenty leagues from the Palace. It should be safe for the moment — my loyalty to the Empress has never been questioned and it will take some time for my cover to fail. By then we'll be as far from here as possible."

She nods, relief evident on her face. "Okay."

"There, all finished." I fold up the rag and set it aside. She fumbles with the red robe, trying cover up her arms again and I restrain my instinct to try and help. The girl hasn't been permitted a moment of bodily autonomy for months — I need to let her have this.

Finally she succeeds and leans back against the sofa, resting her head against my shoulder. "I've a nice warm guest room at my manor," I tell her. "With a soft mattress and a fireplace. You'll be able to rest properly while we plan our next move. And there'll be no shortage of food or water. The view as well is exquisite," I add with a smile.

"Oh, thank God." She hugs a pillow to her chest, resting her head on it. "I haven't slept on a real bed in so long. I've barely slept at all."

"Let me go fetch that printout." I pat her shoulder. "I'll be right back."

She nods, and I stand, heading for my desk. I glance at the open feed shrine and notice a device plugged into a mess of green wires, a green lamp blinking on its side. "Lishi?" I ask, turning back to her. "That device — is it supposed to be lit up?"

"It's working!?" Lishuen tries to stand; I rush back to her side to assist her.

"Steady, now."

"Help me back over there, please—"

"Are you sure—"

"I'm sure, please. I'll be fine." Lishuen grabs the handset from the card table and I help her make her way back to the cabinet. As she fiddles with the cables, I retrieve the printed pages from the teletype and power it back off, returning the amulet to its place around my neck.

Lishuen lets out a delighted exclamation. I turn to find her holding up the handset, which is lit up across the face, a miniature imager full of symbols I don't recognize. "It's working," she murmurs. "Oh, thank God, the converter works."

"I'm glad you didn't go through all that for nothing," I reply.

She nods. "Oh, my gosh. Okay. Um." She looks up at me. "Could you… could you maybe fetch my other things from the table?"

"It would be my pleasure." I hand the sheaf of papers. "Here's everything the Office has on you, as requested."

"Oh! Thank you!" She grabs the papers, scanning them rapidly as I carry the rest of her equipment over to the cabinet. Then she freezes, staring at the papers unbelieving, hands trembling.

"L-Lishi?" I query gently.

"Twenty… twenty fortnights…" she manages, staring at the paper. "I've… I've been gone for… it's been almost a y-year?"

I touch her gently on the shoulder. "I'm sorry," I murmur.

Her eyes are tearing up again. With violent motions, she folds up the sheaf and thrusts it at me. "Take this," she mumbles. "I can't… I need to focus right now."

I stow the papers safely in an inner pocket of my robe, and watch idly as Lishuen hooks the rest of her galvanic equipment into the feed relay. One by one, the machinery comes to life, little lamps lighting up around the edges. It's hard to guess at what most of it is for — Green tech has long been a subject of fables, and the pagans can't even agree among themselves whether the devices are miracles of the art or unspeakable abominations. Two of our _tian bèi_ were adamant that all of Lishuen's tech should be destroyed immediately, and were quite put out when I forbade them from doing so. The others were more than happy for the chance to study her things, however.


What’s the plan after that?”

I rummage in the bag. “I have a small cache of false identities that I’ve been able to sneak into the system over the years. Including one with your mugshot. Ah, here." I pass her the little booklet. “Your skin is a bit dark but if you dye your hair and wear dark enough spectacles, you should be able to pass for a Kaparttu as far as anyone cares. Nobody expects to see a Green out on the street anyway.”

She takes the passbook, flips through it. “What about the Harmony system? There’s no card in here.”

I grimace. “Even I haven't the power to subvert that. Anything we do requiring a Harmony rating has to happen before mine is blacklisted.”

“What is your rating, anyway?”

“Forty-three, last I checked.”

She glances up at me. “That’s… lower than I expected.”

I sigh. “My grandparents immigrated from the Traverse. They were common folk. We’ve only had a few generations to build any social credit. Still, it’s enough for most purposes.”



“Haven’t your people such machines?” I ask. She shakes her head.

“Oh, we stopped using them a long time ago. Like, centuries before the Great War I think.”

“What on Carnelian do you use instead?” I ask, my curiosity piqued. “Simple telegrams? Surely you must have some efficient manner of conversing with your great thought-engines.”

Lishuen shakes her head, pointing to the device with the miniature keyboard on the table. “We just use portables like that. They talk to each other on wireless. If I had power I could show you.”

-- whenever we were about to meet anyone of significance, Kestrel would always, just before they entered the room, whisper to me some unseemly detail of the woman's private life, some dark little secret that the tabloids would pay for in blood and platinum, words that could unmake decades -- sometimes centuries -- of achievement and destroy overnight a family name. she told me in her later years that it was always her design to keep any of the haughty grandeur with which those of the Court always carry themselves from impressing itself too greatly upon my developing psyche. "When you look a fine Duchess in the eye," she said, "I don't want you to see the gleaming gems, the gaudy hat, the cringeing servants -- I want her still half-dressed in her courtly robes, bending her butlers over bannisters and fucking them 'til they bleed, all the while beating them with her sandals and screaming, *take that, Lady Nightingale*." *these people are beneath us, Raven,* she refrained from saying, in words so clear I heard them anyway -- *i could not chance the risk that you might ever take them seriously.*

it was, too, potent training in the art of restraining one's girlish giggles in the presence of magnates.

"You're going back there?"

"I must. My absence would be entirely too conspicuous. The only means by which we have any hope of escaping this place is if I can buy us some time. They must believe you dead, and myself above suspicion. The truth will out in time; if we are still within the bounds of the Core when this transpires, we are the both of us dead women walking."

Lishuen squeezes her hands together. "Sorry, I… I know you're… of high rank, I just… the thought of willingly returning to that place—"

"I understand entirely. I will be safe, I assure you. My record up unto this point is flawless; I am trusted of the Empress herself. It will take time for them to consider the possibility I have turned traitor, certainly more so than one day. And one day is all we will require."

"You have a ruse in mind?"

I laugh. "My dear, I sit on the Privy Council. At my level, one plans each footstep a fortnight in advance -- six, if she steps against the sovereign."

"I see." Lishuen folds her hands in her lap. "Am I to… await you here?"

"You seem uncomfortable with the prospect."

"I… don't like being alone. I don't know what might happen, I--"

"This is the vacation home of a Vizier, my darling. It is guarded day and night, and the servants will attend you as faithfully as thought you were me."

"Can they be trusted, all of them?"

"Those who I could not keep in my confidence, I found excuses to fire or transfer to my townhouse many days hither. Those who remain are loyal to me personally, and have no particular love for the Empire."

"If you say so." Lishuen is plainly unhappy with the idea.

"Before I depart, however." I touch her softly on the shoulder. To my wonderment, she doesn't even flinch. "I will have need of your services."

"How… so?"

I step back, clasping my hands behind my back. "I will need you to injure me."

*"Wh-what?"*

"I require an excuse to be quit of my duties for a time. It is unlike me to take vacations. Appearing before my subordinates battered and bruised will in addition further dispend of any suspicions that might be raised against me."

Lishuen stares at me. "I… I can't. You've… you've been so kind to me, you saved me, I--"

"And if you wish to *stay* saved, you will rouse yourself and overcome this pitiful emotional block," I respond, momentarily reverting to my courtly persona. "Are you not a case officer of the Adversary, Lishuen? Your kind is made of stern stuff."

Lishuen closes her eyes, inhales deeply, digs her fingernails into her arm again. "I'm sorry. You're right; I'm being childish."

"It is understandable." I beckon. She nods. She's still wobbly on her legs but she's able to stand on her own without clutching the chair.

"What should I…?"

"Use your best judgment. It ought be something noticeable even under my full robes, however. And do not break any bones that my mobility depends upon; we will need every advantage to escape this place."

"So… something on your face or lower arms."

I nod. "Tell me no more. If this is too carefully planned, we may leave some sign of our intent."

"I understand." She steps closer, her hand forming a fist. "I… I'll try not to hurt you any more than I have to."

"Get that soppy, bedamned emotion out of your voice, girl." I spread my arms, pulling back my sleeves to reveal the intricate spiral scars that stretch from the back of my palms to my shoulders. "I took my _ting giau ţú_ without opium or tears; if you think a simple battering will break me, you underestimate me severely."

At the sight of the marks, Lishuen lets out an audible gasp. "I've… I've heard of _giau ţú_ but… this is the first time I've actually seen it." She touches my arm softly. "Stars and skies, this is brutal. How much of your body…?"

"By custom, one decorates the arms and thighs. The back as well, if one is common-born as I am and is not honored with _ţú şèi_. It is currently fashionable at court to extend the process to one's flanks, though the style comes and goes. I remember when I was young it was seen as… showy, but now if one wishes to go before the Empress without creating scandal, it is very much obligatory."

"Do… do the guards make you take off your clothes so they can check or something?"

"Ah, yes. You are unfamiliar with court custom. I apologize." I incline my head. "A woman does not dress in this fashion in the presence of the Empress. Court dress bears much of the body to Her inspection -- to conceal beauty from Her is a great insult, to God and all the Empire."

-- "Your Serenity, I must beg of you a favor."

"If it is in my power to grant, you shall have it," She replies immediately.

I gesture to my blackened eye and cheek. "I have done my best to maintain my strength in the presence of my colleagues, but I cannot lie to my Empress. Yesterday's events have lessened me shamefully. To be attacked here in this holy place… my thoughts are scattered in the wind; my will wavers before a heart that will not cease pounding. No focus can I bring to bear upon my duties. Even my own office has become submerged in a sea of terror, in which I drown, every moment a waking death. I have found respite only by fleeing to the peace of my forest manor, tail between my legs. I do not believe I can long serve the Empire in this state. Ten and ten thousand apologies to your Serenity, that you should have to bear my weakness--"

The Empress smiles softly. "You need a vacation," she says.

I drop my head. "I… aye, your Serenity."

"My dearest Raven." The Empress takes me by the shoulders, looks me in the eye. "For years beyond counting now you have served me faithfully and without rest. You are the only woman on the whole of the Privy Council never to claim a moment of time for your own, and were you not so fearsomely effective, I might well have commanded that you do so long hither. Go! Take however much time you desire; you have more than earned this. And do not even think of returning until you are calmed and whole once more."

"Your Serenity is far too kind." I clasp my hands at my waist. "I… you will send word, will you not, if any matters of urgency arise--"

The Empress laughs. "In the business of Empire all matters are urgent. But if it will calm your nerves, I will give you my solemn word that you shall be kept advised of all major developments, should you venture so far afield as the very Fringe or into the Barbarian East."

I bow low. "Thank you. Thank you, your Serenity, ten and ten thousand boons upon your name. I am undeserving of such kindness, such resolute magnanimity--"

"You are perhaps the most deserving of all the Privy Council," She says, and for the first time I feel a flicker of genuine shame. "I shall survey the court, and see you are furnished with a ranked list of the most recommended resorts throughout the Realm. Tell me, dear dame -- have you yet been offworld?"

Would that I could betray this Empire without betraying Her.

"I cannot say I have had the privilege, your Serenity."

"Oh, but it is exquisite! Alas, as so involved an undertaking it is yet a rare privilege; I would this were not so. But have you here not a grand opportunity? Long have you ably defended our Realm against all fell forces within and without, yet scarcely have you enjoyed the slightest fraction of its glories! What justice is there in this?

"Go, see the Jewelled Forests of Sundered Apex! The God-Peak on Resolute Pearl, the highest mountain in all the Civilized Galaxy! The underwater cities of ! Or perhaps, go to the East, and see for yourself what our new conquests have brought into my dominion. The Fallen Acropolis of the Whispering Valley -- over six million years old, our archaeologists tell me, and yet still so much intact; I yearn to visit it myself one day. See one, see them all if you would!" She puts a hand to my cheek. "And contemplate as you do, that your touch is on all these wonders. Your fingerprint marks our worlds each and every one. These places all owe their safety and prosperity to your selfless labors."

I nod slowly. "Your Serenity makes a compelling argument. Perhaps… perhaps I will. I am growing old, and it would sorrow me were I to go to the next life not once having seen the stars in their grandeur."

"Then it is decided!" The Empress beams. "Oh, Dame Raven, I do abominate what has befallen you, but as ever I would look to the brighter side of things: if it buys you the will to renew yourself, and perchance teach you the importance of leisure, perhaps we all shall profit yet."

I incline my head. "I do not doubt your wisdom, your Serenity. If only such old habits as mine were easily broken…"

"Aye, you are presently the only Vizier of common birth, are you not? Betimes I forget this. Ah, if only those of the Blood took their duties so seriously, our Realm should rival the Shadows in power and prosperity!" She shakes her head. "Go, daughter. You have my blessing."

I bow again. "I shall depart for the void as soon as I have prepared the Vizierate for my absence."

That hurt.

That hurt a lot worse than being punched by Lishuen. More easily would I endure another bout of scarification than face Her again.
