The first few rays of golden sunlight pierce Niltar's eyes as she stirs in bed. She winces, turning her head away from the window, momentarily confused by the unfamiliar surroundings -- and then as her memories begin to catch up with her, her eyes start to sting with all-too-familiar tears.

The trembling of her body against his is enough to rouse Livkir. Blinking sleepily, he strokes her bare back and she presses her forehead against his chest, trying to bury her tears. "Hey," he murmurs softly, tugging the blankets up to her shoulders. "What's up, Nil?"

"It wasn't a dream, right?" Her voice quivers as she speaks, riven with terror and doubt. "That wasn't just a dream--"

"It wasn't just a dream. They're letting her go. We're gonna get her back."

Niltar's shoulders sag and she begins to sob quietly, tears of relief streaking her cheeks. Livkir wraps an arm around her waist and cups the back of her neck in his free hand, pulling her closer and kissing her softly on the top of the head. He can feel her heart pounding up against his chest. It takes a while for her to calm down, and when her tears finally stop, her muscles slacken in Livkir's grip, and she closes her eyes, spent.

"Thank you," she whispers hoarsely.

"I wish you'd told me." He squeezes the back of her neck gently, eliciting a flicker of a smile and quiet, involuntary little sound. "I'm so sorry you had to go through two whole nights of sleeping alone."

"I never thought…" She trails off and shakes her head.

Livkir sighs. "You really still think I'm just putting up with you for Cas' sake."

After a long moment, she gives a small nod, burying her face in a pillow.

"Nil. You are a brilliant, passionate, thoughtful, witty, creative, incredibly fun girl. Broken, sure, but your issues aren't all you are; they never have been. All those nights the three of us spent together — did you think I was just pretending to laugh at your jokes? To be interested in all your stories about subnet drama? Stars and skies, Nili, I've had one of your paintings up over the sofa for years." He ruffles her hair. "Did you really think all of that was insincere?"

She exhales. "I… I guess." Livkir rolls his eyes.

"You're ridiculous." He takes her by the chin and forces her to turn towards him. "Nili, look at me. Look me in the eye. *You are important to me.* You're not just… just an extension of Cas. You don't stop mattering just because she's not here. *You are my friend* and I care about you deeply, and I always, always will. Remember that pledge we all made to each other? Over shots out on the deck last Year's End?"

She nods slowly, smiling ever so faintly at the memory. "Yeah."

"I meant every word I said."

She closes her eyes, nods again. "I did too."

"So no more of this attitude, okay, Nil? Stop treating yourself like you don't matter. Even if you can't accept that you matter to anyone else but Cas -- to Sal, to Shay; I swear, even to Lisuan, in her own way -- accept that you matter to me. Please."

"…okay."

"Thank you." Livkir hugs her again; she murmurs sleepily and wraps her arms around his neck and shoulders. He strokes her thigh and neck as she lays there, and she giggles softly.

"Mmh. That feels nice. Did Cas teach you how to handle me or something?"

Livkir laughs. "Like she'd need to. Handling girls is easy." He squeezes her thigh and she lets out an involuntary squeak, cheeks reddening. "You especially; you're so sensitive."

"Well, yeah, I'm not some big dumb *boy,*" Niltar mutters.

"It's not just that. You're way more responsive than any girl I've ever been with either. What's up with that, Nil?"

She shrugs. "Dunno." In a quieter voice she adds, "Probably has something to do with, y'know, going all those years without anyone so much as laying a hand on me."

"…oh, Nili. No wonder you didn't want to sleep alone."

She flops over on her back, staring at the ceiling. "You wanna know something fucked up?"

He leans closer. "Always."

"I used to get myself in trouble on purpose just so I'd get flogged for it. Because that was the only time anyone ever touched me. And hurting on the outside still felt so much better than hurting on the inside."

"Oh, *Nili.*"

"I think that's why Sal was so worried yesterday. He thought I was doing the same old shit again."

"Come *here.*" Livkir pulls her closer, wrapping the crook of his arm around her neck, and he feels her muscles slacken instinctively, the way they always do when she wants to be held, whether she knows it or not. "Stars above, Nil, you poor thing. How long did that go on?"

Niltar sighs. "Sal put a stop to it when he figured it out. I cried in his office and I begged him not to. That was actually what ended up with him introducing Cas to me. She wasn't even meant to be a _vartash_ at first, just… someone to be with. Someone to keep me company and keep me warm at night." She looks down. "That was the idea, anyway."

"…what do you mean?"

Niltar looks away. "I couldn't deal. It wasn't enough. I was begging her to hurt me in the end, to… cuff me and beat me the way they did before. When she finally gave in a little…" She shivers. "I think that was when I started falling hard for her."

Livkir's eyes open wide. "You *wanted* to be hurt?"

"It just… I don't know. Sal thinks it's just 'cause I spent all that time with nothing else like intimacy in my life except for beatings, and it burned some kind of connection into my brain circuits between… pain and feeling safe. Or not alone. Or something." She shrugs. "All I know is, when Cas would… do things to me, it felt good. *Feels* good," she corrects herself, glancing away, cheeks aglow with embarassment. "Better than a fuck ever could."

Livkir gazes at her for a long moment, then pulls her head in under his chin and hugs her tightly. "I don't know what to say," he murmurs at last. "I just… I'm sorry I never made the effort to get to know you back then. I'm so sorry you had to be so alone for so long. Nobody should ever have to go through something like that, least of all someone with your damage. I wish I had known."

"Turned out alright, didn't it?" Niltar shrugs as Livkir loosens his grip, looking up into his brilliant green eyes. "Like… I don't know. I don't think of it like that. Being able to feel pain the way I do… I treasure it, Liv, I really do. Maybe that's a fucked up thing to say but— nothing else feels the same. Nothing else pushes that same set of buttons. It's so special and intimate and being able to share that with Cas… sometimes it almost makes me feel like it was meant to be this way."

Livkir gives her a faintly sad smile, rubbing the back of her neck, a little more forcefully than before. "I'm… I'm glad you got something positive out of it, Nili. I really am."

"Mmh. Liv?"

"Yeah?"

"Would… do you think… could you maybe give me a backrub? I just… I haven't had one in so long and--"

He tousles her hair. "I'd love to. Come on, turn over."

Niltar twitches slightly as he works her over, massaging her with just enough force to make her nerves light up with little sparks of pain. "…ahh, gosh. I d-don't deserve this," she whispers, eyelids fluttering. "I don't deserve *you*."

"Sure you do," he replies lightly. "I don't want you to be lonely again, Nili. I don't want you to suffer. We swore we'd all look after each other, take care of each other for as long as we live. You deserve that kind of safety and security after everything you've been through; you sure have been here for me when I needed it."
 
She responds with just a quiet little murmur, the way she always does when she's too overwhelmed with happiness and gratitude to speak.

"So *this* is how Cas keeps you under control, huh?" Livkir teases. "I'll have to remember this next time you start swinging punches at me."

"I— I'm r-really sorry—"

"Shh." He touches a finger to her lips. "I'm just teasing you, Nili. I'm not mad about that at all, I promise."

"You're s-sure good at this. D'you practice on Lisuan, then?" Niltar manages a faint smirk. "Or should I say 'Lisi?'"

Livkir rolls his eyes. "I swear I'm not fucking Lisuan. That girl is too hardcore for me anyway."

"Then how do you know she likes pain so much, hm?"

"I should have known that was going to come back to haunt me." Livkir laughs ruefully. "Come on, Nili, you've seen her fight."

"So?"

"Her style's so aggressive. It's pure offense; she doesn't even bother trying to dodge blows. She just takes them and keeps on going. Haven't you noticed that?"

"I… maybe?"

"And she toys with people. She drags out fights way longer than she needs to. Shows off her bruises like trophies. Also like — you know how she gets when she's fighting. Her face, her body language -- the longer the fight goes on, the more *excited* she gets." He loosens his grip, strokes her neck with one hand, her flank with the other. "I don't know, I think there's something up with that."

Niltar laughs quietly. "That almost makes me wonder… maybe she's just using our UC sessions for the same thing I got myself flogged for." She flashes a cruel little smile. "Maybe she's just as desperate as I was."

"Come on, Lisuan?" Livkir shakes his head. "You know how many groupies she has. Half the girls in the cohort are nursing crushes on her."

"Okay but can you even imagine, I don't know, Silvar or someone like her *on top?* Of *Lisuan?*" Niltar giggles aloud at the thought. "Shit, I don't even think any of the *boys* could take her, let alone her *groupies*. Remember that one sparring session? Even Sarvash -- y'know, the T-0 Oldworlder who spent like a decade breaking slaver ass on the borderworlds -- even he had to call it a *tie* after going at it gold-on-gold with her for like half a fucking hour. And he's the one who *taught* us all, for fuck's sake!"

Livkir laughs. "Okay, yeah. That's a fair point." He scritches the back of her neck and she snuggles closer. "If that's true, then think about it -- she's got no one. No one to take charge, no one to comfort her, no one to make *her* feel safe and wanted. No one to hold her when she cries. And you've got Cas *and* me. You're better off than *Lisuan,* Nili."

"Mm." Niltar nods. "Good point. Can't possibly be true then."

Livkir sighs, rolling his eyes. "You're ridiculous," he repeats, putting a hand on the side of her neck, stroking her softly.

"If it *was* true you'd obviously be out cozying up to her, trying to be her friend the same way you do every single other lost, lonely soul in Tegvar."

"That's not… well, that's not *completely* true—"

Niltar just snickers. "Liv, I love you but you are the most predictable person in our cohort. You--" She stops, as Likvir reaches past her for a slate on the bedside table. "What's up?"

His eyes move back and forth for a few seconds as he scans the text of the message. "It's from Saluin," he murmurs. "Wants us to come by his office 'when we have a moment.'"

Niltar sits bolt upright. "'When we have a moment?' Oh, fuck, I need to get dressed—"

"Jeez, what's the rush?"

"He's from the *Central Worlds,* Liv. They don't start tossing around that kind of language unless you're fucking *late.*" Her hand closes over her robe, and she freezes up. Livkir pats her back.

"Nili?"

"I just— I'm—" She wipes fresh tears from the corner of her eyes with a quivering hand; her breath is hard and hints of anger are bleeding into her voice. "Blood and thunder, why can't I keep it together for long enough to *take a goddamn shower—*"

*"Oh."* Livkir takes her by the shoulder, tugs her gently. "Hey, like — if you want, we could try, like — we could just go to the guys' showers and if there's anyone else still there, I could just ask them if they'd be okay with you coming in with me?"

She looks up at him, eyes wide. "You'd… really do that?"

"Nili, hon. You keep acting like everything is such a big deal—"

"That *is* a big deal, really— it's completely against protocol—"

Livkir shrugs. "Well, we've got to learn how Saluin and his lot do things in the Central Worlds. I think it's only fair they learn how we do things in the Colonies."

Cassil attracts odd glances as she makes her way through the crowd. Unfamiliar faces are not exactly uncommon here, but with her head down and shoulders hunched, she stands out in a sea of smiles and soft, friendly chatter. The noise rolls over her and she shivers at its texture; she doesn't need to listen carefully to place the dialect of the people surrounding her.

*This is our capital.* Ours. *Why the fuck are* they *the only ones here?*

A series of faintly musical chimes rings out. The unfamiliar sound of a decelerating maglev catches her attention, and she spares an upward glance at the intercity liner. It glides effortlessly toward her, silent but for an eerie electronic warbling and the quiet whoosh of air as it slows from frightening speed to a complete halt in moments. The huge vehicle stretches upwards and away into the distance, dwarfing the little trams and streetcars that she's used to travelling on.

They offered her a choice. A priority seat on a Core Line hauler, back to Tegvar in two hours tops. "Why? So you can keep tossing me around in the dark like a sack of _neshral?"_ she spat. The other choice was travel auth for a half-day surface rail trip to the other side of the continent, which she picked without hesitation.

She's starting to regret it.

The crowd moves as if directed by a single overriding consciousness, flowing with perfect grace into orderly queues around her. Cassil feels the urge to make a scene, push and shove and force her way through, give these snobby fucks something to raise their eyebrows about — but no. *I need to get back to her. That's all that matters. No more taking chances.* Gritting her teeth, she lets her programming take over, watching herself slip into place in the line from a distance as though her body's on autopilot, hands clasped dutifully behind her back, and bitterly swallows her self-disgust.

This would be humiliating enough if she wasn't surrounded by _vintashar._

A transit cop smiles at her as she boards; she rewards him with a glare and stalks off towards the stairs. There's no pass for him to check -- that all happened automatically the moment she stepped on board the train, and the absence of blaring alarms was all the paperwork she needed. *I bet they don't put cops on their own trains. He's just there to keep us rowdy colonials in line.* She grits her teeth. *Why can't you smug fucking* suftefinar *just go* home.

She climbs all the way to the third level, and settles into a nook by the wall where she can see most of the coach, leaning gratefully back into the warm, soft cushion that wraps around the seat. It's mostly empty up here. The Centrals won't come up this far until the seats below are all filled, one by one, and that's not likely to happen with a crowd this size. She stares out the window, past the tracks and into the lush tropical forest that the station's architecture winds artfully through. *They won't even pick their own train seats. How emasculated can you get—*

"Forgive me, young comrade?"

Cassil spins, eyes fixing on the interloper, heart pounding all over again. It's the cop from earlier. She shrinks back into the seat. *"What do you want?"* she growls, trying to sound dangerous and cringeing inwardly when she hears the fear in her own voice. Her rough colonial cadences crackle and spit like sparks from a raw wire. The cop raises an eyebrow.

"I hope you will forgive the intrusion." He inclines his head. Around them, the train comes to life, and Cassil is pressed back into the seat by the sudden force of the acceleration. The officer doesn't even appear to notice, effortlessly keeping his footing. "It is most highly irregular for such a young woman to travel unaccompanied on an intercity route, and—"

"I have every right to be here!" Her knuckles whiten. "I haven't done anything wrong."

"…unquestionably so," the officer concurs, taking a step back and regarding her carefully. "I did not mean to imply otherwise, comrade. My intent was only to inquire after your wellbeing; clearly you are in an unusual and unfamiliar situation, and to make matters worse you are alone in an empty coach level."

She stares at him for a moment, as though he's a riddle that will unravel itself if she just looks hard enough. His handset sits in its holster on his crisp and spotless dress uniform, a grenade waiting for its pin to be pulled. "I'm fine," she says. "I'm *fine,* okay?"

He bows. "To hear this gladdens me greatly." She flinches as he touches her softly on the shoulder. "May we in any way be of service to ease the burden of your voyage?"

Her eyes search his face for an answer that isn't forthcoming. His pretty green eyes and dimpled cheeks radiate nothing but innocent concern, tousles of platinum-blond hair that curl out from underneath his beret gently understating his authority. "I'm fine," she says again, more quietly, in a voice now simply sullen and exhausted. "Please just leave me alone."

"As you wish. Please do not hesitate to summon me should you require any assistance whatsoever." He backs away, inclining his head again. "A pleasant journey to you, comrade."

"Whatever," she mutters, turning back to staring out the window, watching his reflection until he's out of sight. Only then does her heartbeat start to slow.

Sucking in a deep breath of air, she props her feet up on the opposing seat, and presses a switch on the table in front of her. A neatly concealed compartment pops open, and she pulls a slate from its dock.

---

Niltar's still blushing faintly as she steps out of the shower-hall assigned to the cohort's male half, distractedly wrapping a towel around her upper body. Livkir, towel around his waist, takes her by the arm and orients her in the direction of her own dormitory.

"I had no idea you were so into boys, Nili," he teases; her cheeks redden further.

*"Neither did I—"*

"That was so nice of Caishen to stand guard at the door for you — I've always liked him."

Niltar looks away. "He just wanted an excuse to stand around showing off his muscles, I'll bet you anything."

"Here's a crazy thought." Livkir pats her back as he pulls open the door to her dorm. As they step inside, the recessed lamps in the ceiling light up to a gentle purple glow, Niltar's favorite color. "Have you ever thought about, I don't know — just flirting with people you're attracted to and seeing where it goes?"

*"How the fuck am I supposed to do that."*

Livkir furrows his brow. "What do you mean?"

"What do you mean, what do I mean? Like. I don't know. How do you always know exactly what to say? How are you so good at making people laugh? I mean, like, I can't just march up to someone and be like, 'hey dumbass, you're hot, wanna fuck?', you know."

"I mean, that would probably work on Cai—"

*"Don't tempt me."* Niltar tosses the towel over the back of a chair and yanks a light pink _rancal_ from the dressing rack. "I have enough drama going on in my life as it is today."

Livkir pauses by the door. "You gonna be okay dressing on your own? Or do you want me to wait here for you?"

She gives him an awkward, guilty nod. "S-sorry, I just—"

*"Nili.* It's okay. You don't need to keep explaining your anxieties to me." Livkir rolls his eyes, letting the door click shut behind him. Niltar fastens the tail of her robe behind her and grabs the towel, idly drying her hair. Her eyes are wild, and there's a frantic note in her voice as she looks up at Livkir.

"Why is everyone being so *nice* to me, Liv?"

"What? They're just— they're just being normal people, I don't—"

"Yes, you do. Yes you do! You remember how people treated me… I don't know, a year ago." She throws her towel at Livkir, who catches it neatly. "Everyone's been acting weird lately. Being all polite and shit. The fuck is going on?"

"Nili." Livkir steps closer, puts a hand on her shoulder. She starts at the touch, her full attention landing on him at once. "The past is the past. None of us are fourteen anymore -- nobody's going to keep grudges from when they were a kid. And I mean--" He gestures vaguely at her. "Have you looked in a mirror lately, Nil?"

"The fuck are you getting at?"

"You're kinda hot, is what I'm getting at. You're not the… frumpy teenage girl who was always looking for a fight, who dyed her hair black and never cut it until it was so long she couldn't see. You treat people way better than you used to, you're fun to be around, you're…" He shrugs. "People like what they see now, that's all."

Niltar laughs unsteadily, heading for the door. "Bull-*shit.* Skies above, you're always such a… you always think the best of everyone. Always come up with the sunniest, happiest possible reasons for anything--"

"I'm serious, Nil." Livkir follows her out into the hall, gently steering her towards his dorm. "Come on, you can't seriously expect everyone to keep treating you the way they used to for the rest of their lives just because of how you were when you were a kid?"

"What, are they all going to just magically forget that shit I pulled at--"

"I might suggest, Nili," Livkir interrupts, taking her by the cheek and lifting her chin to make her look him in the eye, "that *you're* the one who's thinking too *little* of people."

She scoffs derisively, pulling away like a frightened animal. "Come *on*--"

"Dead serious, Nil. Remember what they taught us in Pol Econ? You judge a theory by its predictive value."

"What? What's that got--"

"It *means,*" Livkir continues gently, "that you should take our two theories, figure out which one predicts what, and then see which prediction lines up better with the observed data." He holds open the door for her. "I'll bet you mine's the good one."

She crosses her arms. "Loser has to choke down a bottle of Fernhollow Reserve?"

"The R1387 vintage?" Livkir winces. "You sure you want to do that to yourself?"

"You're fucking *on,* smug boy." She gazes at him defiantly as he dresses himself. "And you're going *down.*"

"You gotta cite some actual *evidence,* though," Livkir rejoins, waving a finger. "You don't just get to say, 'I was right, you lose.'"

"You think I won't be able to?"

"Honey, I *know* you won't." Livkir tugs his robe taut across his chest, finishing the wrap with a few practiced motions. "This is going to be one brutal lesson in humility for you."



The quartermaster eyes Livkir as he reaches for a slate. "The 1387 vintage?" he asks. "Someone lose a bet or something?"
