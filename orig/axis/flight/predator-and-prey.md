# Predator and Prey

Feranya plays tenderly with the courier boy's short golden hair as she wipes blood from his neck with gentle strokes of a silk kerchief. She admits freely to herself that she got more than she bargained for tonight. Stressful, at first, given the circumstances, but, at the same time, she didn't realized how much she needed it. To just let go for a while.

She had to reassert control eventually, of course, but for once it proved an exhilarating challenge. A fine game. She won in the end of course; it dampens her easy mood somewhat to admit it, but that was hardly ever in question. Woman though she might be, she has advantages beyond mere strength.

The boy is clearly lapsing in and out of consciousness. She shouldn't need to worry about him for a time. She kisses him fondly, massaging her wrists, and rises. A chill pierces the room as she opens the rain-pattered window, and she fastens up her wine-red bodysheathe to quell the shivers that take hold of her. The end of a cigarette blackens in the low candleflame and she lifts it to her lips, inhaling the warm, sweet smoke. It stings her lungs, and her body responds, senses sharpening, the day's fatigue receding. She turns her gaze outward.

The moons are bright above the sleeping countryside, casting the great trees in a ghostly raiment of silver and crimson. The Cindermoon is far distant in her orbit, visible only as a sullen red point high on the horizon.

Curiously, Feranya espies figures moving below the swaying trees. Kepet's breath is a mild thing here, attenuated perhaps by the bulk of the Stormgate; nothing like the rip-roaring mountain gales that were a fixture of her distant childhood. But she knows all the same that the weather outside is not something the fragile locals would expose themselves to by choice, even under carriage-shelter.

By what misfortune would a Seprenan be plying the roads this night?

She leans closer to the little scene, fixing it in her too-keen eyesight, and frowns. The carriage beneath the wooden skybreak is of peculiar size and style. There [!are] patricians to be found in this rural abyss, to be sure, but those are provincial lords and ladies, stuffed shirts to make the embarassment of their greater families. [!That] carriage simply reeks of gold. She'll not be in the least surprised if the light metal plating on the doors proves to be of alchemic alloy, unnaturally resilient. She can't quite make out the heraldry from here, but it almost doesn't matter. It lacks the familiar ostentation of the Seven, which disturbs her. All that expense, and still it's built for function over form.

Whatever these people are doing here, they're dangerous.

She watches on, transfixed, as the tired, damp figure of the waymaster bustles out to the carriage, where he bends down and exchanges words with the driver in his sheltered compartment. Then he turns and opens the passenger door, bowing obsequiously as he does, and figures in armor begin to climb out.

Feranya's heart nearly stops then and there.

Four figures emerge from the carriage. The first three, Feranya almost dares hope she is somehow mistaken, but the fourth confirms it.

[!How?]

[!HOW?]

She staggers backwards, forcibly gentling her touch as she moves to seal the window against the terrors below. The last thing she wants is to draw their attention by slamming it. The three Knights-Vigilant are bad enough. But an allgodsforsaken [!Paragon?] Blacken and bedamn them!

She dons her cloak in a flurry of fabric, and goes immediately to her luggage, a small duffel with little what remains of her worldly possessions. She stands stock still for a moment, thoughts racing at the speed of total panic. Her fingers close around her sturdy little travelbow, but after a moment she realizes the folly of trying to snipe at her adversaries from the window. They would cut her down in moments. Reluctantly she relinquishes the bow and reaches for her knives instead.

How am [!I] worth sending a godsbedamned [!Paragon?]

She briefly considers flight, but dismisses the thought almost as soon as it occurs. They have horses. She has nothing but her own two feet. Even if she broke off into the woods, she'd fast lose her way, and her trail would be plain to even the meanest tracker come sunrise. She is a creature of cities; of smoke, gold, poisons, deceit, and base pleasures. Not a forest ranger. [!Certainly] not the kind with the skill to brave a night such as this. The tempest beyond the murky glass may not impress her overmuch, but she is yet a child of the Stormgate. She knows [!damn well better] than to tempt great Kepet. Tonight's autumn darkness is not long survivable.

No. There's only one solution.

Somehow, the zealots have to die.

Feranya plans furiously as she creeps down the stairs, her steps not raising the mildest protest from the ancient oak planks, her daggers in a death grip. Even in the dark, three Vigilants would be pushing it at the best of times. A single Paragon is a wildcard. The bitch will know her tricks. She risks a contest of blades if she engages directly, and that, she knows, she will lose. As keen as her skill with the knife may be, she can't match the raw, inhuman celerity and strength of a Paragon. That was, after all, the whole point.

She reaches the bottom of the stairs, and steals into the kitchen, where she crouches down and waits. The light is impenetrably low, but that works just fine for Feranya Adivani. At some level, she has always been a creature of the night.

The Solar zealots tromp into the main hall. Feranya stills her body and her breath, watching, invisible in the midnight murk, though she sees her foes plainly enough. They converse for a time, the frazzled waymaster keeping up the rear. She flinches as he kindles light, and almost pulls back, but it's only a small candle. Not enough to goad her from her lair, but enough to ruin a man's night vision.

She wishes she could shoot the Paragon then and there. It would eliminate by far the greatest threat. But then she would have three men bearing straight down on her. A bloody elf might be able to loose arrows faster than three men with firearms could loose bullets, but she certainly can't.

And gods alone know how much an arrow to the breast really would incommode a Paragon.

No. She'll have to be smart about this.

The waymaster bustles behind the bar, and she hears the rustle of paper. Consulting his ledgers. No doubt directing them to her very room. More quiet conversation, of which Feranya catches only fragments, despite her phenomenal hearing.

[!"Scars, you say? That matches the profile…"]

[!"Hadn't the barest notion, I say. Right fortunate we are, you were passing…"]

[!"The Lady guards her faithful."]

[!"…to be crass, but… perchance, a reward…?"]

[!"…let you keep the [!bribe] she paid you instead of…named an enemy of the Prophet…"]

[!"…ah…perfectly reasonable…spare key, if you'll pardon me a moment…"]

She breathes, slowly and deliberately, preparing her body for combat. But then, the Paragon, blessed be the Four, heads upstairs with the waymaster and one of the Vigilants, leaving the others to cover the exit. Feranya blinks, her heart calming ever so slightly. [!Well. That makes things easier.]

[!I thought these people had top-of-the-roster training.]

Then something belatedly occurs to her.

[!I didn't pay anyone a bribe this time.] She stifles a wry laugh. [!Unless you count what I gave the courier.]

[!What exactly is going on here?]

Feranya sheathes her blades at each thigh, pulling her cloak in around her, and then blunders out of the kitchen, swearing aloud as she trips over nothing in particular. "Fuck me up and sideways!" she exclaims in a grating rural accent. "Where is the blessed [!light—] oh!"

She feigns surprise as the fool Vigilants hurry up to her, praising the darkness for concealing her color as they help her to her feet. "Thank you, thank you so," she gushes, clasping one by the arm and latching onto him like a famished fangleech. "Lady be blessed but you can't see a [!thing] down here!" She looks up to the knight she's attached herself to. "Oh! Do [!you] know, where that [!ratfucked] old water cask might be at? Or at least the ratfucking housemaster. If you can call him any such thing. This place is a right *shambles,* I tell you. A man ought to be shamed. Shamed, I say!"

The Vigilant gives an exasperated sigh halfway through the tirade, and glances at his partner. "Take the door, will you? I'll see to the poor clumsy wench."

"Aye, Takha." Feranya surpresses a shudder at the clipped accent of the coaltop, though perhaps she should be more aggrieved that one of them is apparently Seprenan blood.

"Here, young mistress. It's all well. I think the casks are over about there."

"Oh! Thank you; thank you, kindest sir." Feranya has to consciously stop herself playing up the accent [!too] much. The man is not a cabaret-goer sloshed thrice over; he is a coldblooded fanatic who will not hesitate to cut her open if he begins to suspect who she is.

Or, more to the point, what.

She makes a show of fumbling with the cask faucet, before pausing and looking up, squinting at the guard. "Here now," she exclaims, infusing her words with suspicion and affront. "You hain't one them regular guards. Who are you, then?" As far as she knew, the wayhouse didn't [!have] its own guard, but the fanatics wouldn't know that.

The Vigilant claps his fist to his heart, likely more out of habit than anything else. "You are in the hands of Knights of the Vigilant Order, sworn protectors to all faithful and the Temple of the Sun, in the name of Lady and Prophet. You may be assured we are here to help."

[!Yeah, and Valley longhorns enjoy a good game of peddler's tarot,] she doesn't say. Instead she affects the
