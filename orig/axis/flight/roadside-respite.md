# Roadside Respite

There were times when Seri Imaela loved the autumn season. The blood-bright leaves that presided over harvest rites even as their fallen cousins crackled underfoot. The exuberant winds off the sea. Fluffy wool coats and apple cider, stories and prayers around the bonfire. The autumn world of her best years brimmed all the more with life in the dimming days of light, as though every creature that breathed was getting in one last romp before the curtain of winter closed. Before the fields fell still and every man and beast went scurrying back to his lair in advance of Kepet's wrath.

There is none of that childhood cheer in this autumn evening. It is grim and it is chill, and the whispered conference of the leaves in the wind is one of urgent hostility, ugly rumors and hissed threats. The birds have fled across the Rift, and the rain that falls is not a gentle sprinkle. The drops are fat and wet and colder than they have any right to be. The fading sun's last warming rays are tangled in the trunks and branches of the enveloping forest, and offer her no comfort. There's only the dusty cobbles beneath her feet as she trudges on, and a chill that bites bone-deep, and a sense of utter, black futility that chides her every wearying footstep.

Her legs ache of ruin. She has lost count of the days she's spent in this sorry fugue of walking, interrupted only to thieve by night some bit of sustenance from the intermittent farming village. Her criminal labors have bought her a thin cloak of rough fabric, as tattered as her body, a worn shoulder-satchel, a small handful of coin. Once she dared a few small cures for a woodland family, the only honest silver she's earned in several moons. They were the first people she spoke to in a fortnight. Simple folk, kind and gentle. Her voice has lain unused since.

Even the most businesslike part of her soul has since given up tallying the abuses heaped on her body. At first she entertained some notion of repair, that a time would come when she might lay down and rest and treat her own accumulating battle damage. The notion was never more than fever dream, and she let it pass long hither. Now she just walks, and hides, and tries to remember how to hope.

Her wounds are barely healing. Not enough nutriment, and no excess stamina to spare. She's salved them as best she can by the bounty of those wild plants she knows by heart. But that bounty is meagre compared to purpose-bred garden strains. These are selfish plants that must worry overmuch for their own well-being, and have precious little physick to yield up. Her pain is ill soothed.

There is fire now, on the horizon. She squints, as if it will do any good, making out only a wavering light. A flame man-kindled. Perhaps a wayhouse? Her pace across the dusty cobblestones falters as she considers. 

Her soul is scarce prepared for reason. Some part of her still understands the danger, but she is too battered, too sore, too long gone from civilized comforts and soft beds. It's no choice, then. Before she takes another step she's made up her mind. There was no real thought to it. Just the raw working of animal need.

As she trudges onward, the light resolves into a panoply of lanterns, set high in the walls of a middling wayhouse. A rough wooden building with stables out back, architecture scarcely recognizable as Seprenese. Figures move in the lanternlight, and before long, she hears the notes of bardsong.

She counts her coin, and wonders how long she can afford to rest here. She knows she needs to stay moving, but part of her rebels at the thought. [!Moving? Where to? What is the point of running when you've nowhere left to run to?]

But she still has somewhere to run from.

[!One night,] she decides. [!I'll stay one night. Then I'll reevaluate. I can hardly think in this state.]

The relief that washes over her as she wanders through the doors is unutterable. Body and soul are slammed by a physical wave of warmth, and against her better judgement she closes her eyes a moment to drink in the giddy sound and music. This is a taste of the autumn cheer she knew, and it sparks a yearning in her heart. But first things first.

"A pint if you would, sir. Of… whatever you have that's strongest."

The waymaster looks down at her appraisingly.

"You sure you can hold that kind of rotgut, love?" he asks gently. Seri snorts.

"I sure hope not."

The waymaster shakes his head and chuckles. "I'll not deny your coin." He begins filling a mug from a tankard. "Tell me then. What brings a wee thing like you out here on such a night? I heard no horse fetch in."

"A paltry purse and poor decisions," Seri reponds distantly. It's true enough, after a fashion. She throws back a mouthful of bitterbrand, and makes a face. "Bend me over a barrel but that's the worst drink I've ever tasted." She finishes the mug and pushes it back towards the waymaster. "Another, kindly, sir."

He guffaws. "I'll have to fetch another from the cellar. I only keep that swill in stock for soldiers and beggars, in truth."

Seri considers this, and nods. "Right enough, I figure."

As the waymaster disappears down the back stairs, Seri turns her gaze belatedly to the crowded tables. The wretched drink is a better balm than she could have hoped to concoct on her own in the forest, suffocating her pains and enveloping her nerves and thoughts in a tranquil, soothing haze.

The wayhouse is such an innocent place. There is no sign of danger. No pain and fear, no enemies in shadow. Not even a cutpurse to be seen. Just simple drunken reverie as far as the ear can hear. It's nice. It's comfortable. It's [!tempting.]

But forgetting is dangerous.

Most of those present must be local farmhands, she decides. They lack the heavy kit and cloth incumbent on an autumn traveller, and their cheap tunics are dirtied with the muck of the fields, not the dust and wet of the road. They carry no blades, save perhaps for a working man's dagger or a carving knife. There is no menace in their mien; their faces, though dirty, are smiling the smiles of hard work well done. They are not here to drown their sorrows, but to celebrate a fat and fine harvest.

Turning back from her covert scan of the crowd, her eyes linger on a young man leaning against the bar, handsome and slim with tousled blond hair. He's arrayed in leather cuirass, the livery of a Shen Tsaperdi courier. She feels a small pang of envy for the blushing girl pressed against his chest. There lies no courtship bond upon her wrist, and Seri purses her lips. [!I could steal him. I] could. [!Just for one night.] One night to rest and recuperate, bare and safe in the hands of another.

It would be fair, and all. Look at the wench, a perfect body all wrapped in finery, with hands that haven't known a day's work. It would be lifting a copper off a patrician. She eyes the boy again, and reevaluates. A silver, perhaps.

But her own bare body carries too many secrets now. Sighing, she makes herself look away, stilling the tears before they can escape her wearied eyes. The waymaster is tromping up the stairs again, a small cask of bitterbrand under his arm, and she forces herself to focus on the promise of further drink.

And yet, she finds her gaze torn back to the flirting couple, more by uncertainty than lust. The girl is an uncommon one. Her fiery red hair, exotic features, and grey-tan skin mark her out immediately as Móravin-born. Seri has seen only a few in her time, always standing starkly out from their surroundings by their height and color, to say nothing of their haughty mien. Their eyes are the strangest thing about them, coming in as many different colors as a field of wildflowers, colors common to no other kindred. This girl is no exception, with ruby irises that glint devilishly in the brazier-light.

What is a creature like [!you] even doing here, of all places?

Then the girl notices Seri's unhappy stare, arching one eyebrow, and she looks away redfaced, gratefully taking a refilled mug from the waymaster.

"Careful now you don't poison yourself, lass," the master cautions her.

"I should be so lucky," she mutters under her breath, and throws back another mouthful.

"Are you… all well, lass?" The waymaster's voice takes on a softer tone, and he leans forward. "I shouldn't pry, but you don't much see Taikari blood in these parts. And I can't help but notice, you look a trice battered about. You haven't fallen afoul of these pagan ruffians, I do hope?"

Seri flinches. "No," she responds, a bit too quickly.

"True pleased to hear that, I am." He straightens. "I only ask on account, there's been violence of late. I'd fear for a daughter of Taihe abroad by night." He glances meaningfully at one of the farmhands. "Ignorance and ugly superstition are deep rooted in these lands, though it shames me to say it. But I promise a child of the true faith is safe in my halls."

"I see," says Seri tightly.

"Not my place. Forgive me, do. Will you be staying with us this night?"

Seri nods. "I will. How much for room? A small room, just for me?"

"Two silver, if you please." He pulls out a dog-eared ledger, plucks a quill from behind one ear.

"And for the drinks?"

He waves her away with a rueful laugh. "I'll not charge it. Take it as weregild for my ill manners."

Seri glances up at him. "I… see. Thank you. That is gracious of you." She fishes in her satchel, and passes the coinage across the table. He weighs them briefly in his hands and sweeps them under the counter.

"Very good, young lass. And your papers, if you will?"

[!Fuck.]

"I'm sorry?"

"Your papers, lass. Your passbook." His brow creases. "You [!have] a pass, have you not?"

"I…" Seri fumbles in her satchel theatrically. "Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry, I'm not used to this. I must have left it behind."

The waymaster clears his throat, looking perturbed. "Well, now, young mistress. I do beg your pardon, but this is a problem. I would not trouble a daughter of holy Taihe, please understand, but the law, well. It is the law. I must have some name to put down in the ledger, should a magistrate wish to inspect it."

"Oh, well. My name is Anuele Ineta Ka'ikame—"

"All well and good, young mistress. All well and good. I believe you, I do." He clasps his hands, looking sincerely uncomfortable. "Only, well, I couldn't say. I couldn't look a magistrate in the eye and say, I knew you true for who you are said to be. I couldn't swear it in the sight of the Lady. Any man can claim to be who he is not, they would say to me."

"I understand, of course. I'm dreadfully sorry about this." Seri reaches into her makeshift purse, counting out twenty silver. "I'll pay the fine, and I promise you it will not happen again."

"The… fine?" The waymaster frowns.

Seri brandishes the coins. "Yes, the fine for traveling without papers. It is a bit much, but I suppose that is what I deserve for my carelessness."

The waymaster raises his eyebrows. "Ah! I see. Well then, that is a different matter entirely. Anuele, you said?"

Seri breathes a sigh of relief as the small heap of coins vanishes away and the waymaster turns to his key cabinet. Part of her cringes to see so much money evaporate before her eyes, but there would have been little point in stealing coin not to spend it. And in truth, a safe bed for a night is worth more than thirty silver.

She'd pay for [!that] in gold.

"Breakfast is served at first light, though we've usually leftovers enough if you're a late riser," the waymaster continues, locking the cabinet and turning back. He passes her a simple brass key, tied to a small sheet of wood with a number carved into it. "If you should want to stay another night, I'd be obliged if you could give me word by noon, or we might sell the room out from under you. Pay the night-creaks no heed; this house has stood strong for generations. And [!snuff] your candles ere you sleep, do. Our walls are thick and you have no need of fire to warm yourself by."

Seri nods, swallowing the last of her mug. "Thank you. I will keep that in mind."

The waymaster moves off to attend the courier and his girl. Seri lingers for a time to enjoy the raucous, half-drunk verse of the house bard, before the lure of a soft bed overtakes her and she hauls her body ungracefully up the stairs. Her room is at the end of the hall, nestled against the far wall. The key rattles in the elderly lock and she slips inside, eagerly pressing the door shut, throwing the bolt, and wedging a chair under the knob.

She doesn't bother to fire the candles, and within moments is fast asleep beneath the sliver-light of the waning moons.

Her dreams are dark. But the world she wakes into is almost worse.
