# Meet the New Boss

“Can I talk to you about your sister?”

Half-asleep, Jasmine rolls over in bed. There's a troubled cast to Sashuan's eyes, which glitter likes emeralds in the peaceful, milky moonlight as she lays on her back beside her. “You know I was just teasing you, right?” Jasmine murmurs, stroking her lover’s thighs with a gentle hand.

“I know.” Sashuan turns her head and kisses her softly. “It’s not about that.”

“Then what is it?”

“It’s…” Sashuan sighs. “It’s a little hard to explain. You know how I told about… about things like _racvol_ and _shanracvol?”_

Jasmine frowns. “Yeah?”

“Well. I’m no counselor, but psychology was part of my spy training.” She hesitates. “Have I ever told you about _ceshracvol?”_

Jasmine shakes her head sleepily. “Nuh-uh. That’s… what is that, *alone…trauma…reaction?”*

“Close.” Sashuan smiles at her. “It’s closer to *abandonment trauma reaction.* _Ceshvol_ for short. Um. I’m bringing it up because I think Rose has it.”

“W-what? Rosie?” Jasmine sits up in bed. “Why? What is it, exactly?”

“It’s… _ceshvol_ is complicated. It’s sort of a… progression of a brain dysfunction we call _cardin_, which is like… ugh, these terms are all so hard to translate.” She shakes her head. “Well, um. _Cardin_ is… we don’t understand _cardin_ and _ceshvol_ very well, but there was a girl back home I used to sleep with now and then who had _cardin_, and she always described it as being like her emotions were just way, way too amped up. Whatever she felt, she felt it really, really intensely — something that might upset you a little bit, like, I don’t know, breaking a dish, she’d do something like that and she’d just break down; sometimes she’d get suicidal. She’d blow up over little annoyances, start fights over nothing. But when she felt good things, the feeling was so strong it was like…” She shakes her head. “Like being high on opium, I guess.”

“That’s… huh.” Jasmine purses her lips. “Rosie… she told me something kind of similar once. And… yeah, she does kind of overreact a lot, but I guess I just thought… well. You know what she’s been through.”

“Yeah.” Sashuan exhales. “The thing that makes _cardin_ distinct is that you don’t just overreact to the bad things. You overreact to the good things too.”

“…like how she’s always so excited to see you.”

Sashuan nods. “Exactly. So that’s _cardin_ — _ceshvol_ is what happens when someone has _cardin_ already and ends up getting abandoned. Like, when someone who’s integrated really deep into your life suddenly goes away and it’s like they take part of you with them.”

“…oh.”

“You see where I’m going with this.”

“Yeah.”

“The thing about _ceshvol_ is it makes loneliness hurt really, really badly. Worse than anything else. So when someone who has it makes a meaningful new connection, they imprint really strongly on the new person and want to spend all their time with her. Remember what your mom told you, that time she caught Rose crying in her room after we left?”

“After *you* left.”

Sashuan nods. “That’s… like I said, I’m no _virtash_, but that’s about as classic _ceshvol_ as it gets.”

Jasmine is silent for a moment. “So between what happened to Dad, Mom spending most of Rosie’s life at work, and leaving her to look after the kids, and then how Rosie lost her girlfriend *and* a boyfriend—” She lays back down, staring at the ceiling. “If… if you’re right, she must be hurting so badly.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of.” Sashuan purses her lips. “When you told me that thing about how she’s not eating… I mean, she’s got a handy justification for it and all, but it sounds to me like self harm. Or… or worse.”

“Oh," Jasmine says in a small voice.

“So I just wanted to, I don’t know. Give you some context for why I’m spoiling her so much. I mean, I like her too, I genuinely enjoy spending time with her and I’m glad I *can* be there for her, but I know she’s in a bad place and I’m trying to do what I can to bring some light into her life.”

Jasmine nestles closer. “Thank you for telling me. Thanks for caring about my sis so much.”

“Of course, love.” Sashuan ruffles her hair. “She’s family, after all.”

“Most people just think she’s too needy. More trouble than she’s worth.”

Sashuan gives an exasperated sigh. “‘Worth.’ Ugh, that’s such an Zyahua thing to say. She’s a sweet person, she’s hurting, and I can help her be happy — why wouldn’t I?”

“Most people want something in return, I guess. More than she’s got.”

“Making someone that happy isn’t enough?” Sashuan replies incredulously. “How could someone see her face light up the way she does when I’m around and not want to keep doing that for her?"

Jasmine is quiet for a long moment.

"I don't know," she says finally.

---

The sun has barely crested the horizon by the time she's finally shaken awake. "You sleep like a _pien şai_, woman," Sashuan grouses as Jasmine rubs her forehead and glares blearily up at the Green. Sashuan is perched atop her in her full dress uniform, black-and-white _rancal_ over snug grey leggings, black beret on her head. Her hair is still wet from the shower, and as Jasmine sits up, she catches a whiff of Sashuan's favorite perfume.

"What the fuck, Sashi, it's barely—"

"It's almost past S9H and you're *still in bed.*" Sashuan hauls her, stumbling, to her feet, taking full advantage of her enormous physical strength. _"Pen a don_, this is the third time I've tried to wake you up—"

"You never go to work this early!"

"You do though." Sashuan pats her on the cheek, yanking her nightgown up over her head to an indignant yelp. "Our appointment is at S8H sharp. You know enough about the People you should want very badly not to be late." She kisses Jasmine softly on the lips, taking her sufficiently by surprise that her muscles slacken in the smaller woman's grip.

"Oh, fuck, right, we have that thing—"

"Fuck, indeed. You're going to finally get that job interview you've been bitching about for months. Awful, I know." Sashuan pats her rear, pointing towards to bathroom. "Go. *Shower*."

"…alright, alright! You don't have to be so—"

Sashuan touches a finger to Jasmine's lips. "'Alright, alright, *ma'am.*'"

"—so fucking *Society* about it." Jasmine rolls her eyes, shivering in the morning chill and grabbing a towel as she heads towards the bathroom.

_"Menit val lina mire,"_ Sashuan replies playfully.

_"Rukhara la'u,"_ Jasmine replies before slamming the door.

She rests her aching head against the tiled shower wall as the hot water caresses her shoulders. It takes a few minutes before she's awake enough to feel anxious, but before long her heart is pounding and her hands quiver with the slightest tremor as she rubs the bar of soap back and forth her skin. *It'll be fine,* she tells herself, over and over. *Sashi'll be with me. I'll be fine. Worst that can happen is I don't get the job. Right?* She bites her lip. *What're they going to think? A citizen and a… a* uastash *like me? Is that going to be a problem? No, no, no, it'll be fine,* Mitiku Khata'e, *stop* worrying *about everything, Jasmine, you're going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine. Sashi wouldn't be dragging you in there if anything bad was going to happen.*

*Fuck, what am I going to wear?*

She emerges from the shower ten minutes later, hair still dripping wet. Sashuan's sitting on the bed, legs crossed, hands in her lap, posture sharp and perfect, and Jasmine swallows hard. Far from her usual messy hair, ragged skirts, and Matikhe-may-care attitude, her girlfriend is effortlessly radiating an aura of absolute discipline. Hair combed back and tied into a slick ponytail, skintight black uniform without a single wrinkle, back straight as a fencepost. The glimpses she's had of *this* Sashuan have been momentary, hazy goodbye kisses amid the gentle fog of sleep. Seeing her like this fully awake is… *fuck, is this what they're going to expect from me?*

Sashuan smiles up at her. "Much better."

Jasmine clears her throat weakly. "…Sashi?"

"Yeah, hon?" 

“Is there, um. Like. H-how should I dress, do you think? I mean. Since— since I need to make a good impression and all?”

Sashuan smirks. “You look fine just like that, babe,” she replies innocently. Jasmine throws a pillow at her.

*“Seriously.”*

“Okay, okay.” Sashuan wraps her arms around the flung pillow and snuggles up to it. “You should go with, like… dark colors, for one. Nothing bright, no patterns, just solid colors. Black or dark grey’s best. —No, no, not that.” Sashuan makes a dismissive gesture at the hoodie Jasmine holds up. “Too loose. You want something skintight, bare shoulders—”

“Oh come *on,”* Jasmine sneers, glancing around in search of another pillow. “You’re just trying to get me to… wear something sexy so you can show me off, aren’t you? ”

“Honey,” Sashuan replies, wounded, “you don’t need to dress up to be hot. And for the record, yes, I absolutely am going to show you off at every opportunity, but I’m actually being serious right now.”

“So, what, sexy is formal for you people or something?”

“It’s… not exactly like that?” Sashuan flops over on her back. “It’s like. You gotta look respectful, I guess. And that means, sort of, making yourself vulnerable. Your body, I mean. Not hiding yourself away. You show up in a big fluffy hoodie, everyone’s gonna take one look at you and think, ‘oh boy, that fucking _uastash_, she’s gonna be trouble, you can just tell she’s got something to hide.’ Whereas, you wear that lovely silky dress I got you, you look like a team player, and professional to boot.”

Jasmine pouts. “Are leggings okay, at least?”

“Only because it's cold.”

“You have got to be kidding me.”

Sashuan giggles. “You’ve seen how we dress, babe. I mean, I could loan you a _rancal_—”

“Alright, fine! I’ll wear the dress.”

“Good girl.” Sashuan stands and pads softly up behind Jasmine, wrapping her arms around her bare waist. Jasmine turns, takes Sashuan’s cheeks between her hands and kisses her tenderly on the lips. She shivers as her partner slips a leg between her thighs, rubbing up against her bare cunt. Sashuan reaches into Jasmine’s tangled hair, taking hold and pulling back, forcing Jasmine to look up at the ceiling as Sashuan takes her time nipping, kissing, and digging her teeth into her lover’s neck.

“Aaah! S-so pants are forbidden, but hickeys are okay?” Jasmine manages, between gasps.

“I gotta mark my property, babe.” Sashuan giggles, and Jasmine whimpers as the tip of Sashuan’s tongue teases her skin. “Oh, I bet you’d like to know what I’m doing down here, huh?” she whispers, pulling Jasmine’s head even further back. “Like to have some forewarning I’m about to savage you, huh? Too. Bad.” She punctuates the last two words with bites, and slowly releases Jasmine. She cups her hands around her partner’s neck, kissing her deeply when she tries to speak. “You’re going to have some real nice bruises before too long,” Sashuan murmurs, caressing one mark with a thumb before pressing hard against it and delightedly watching Jasmine mewl in pain. “Oh, Khata’e’s tits but I could do this to you all morning.”

Jasmine’s face is a deep red. “…it feels wr-wrong how much I wish you would.”

Sashuan smiles brightly up at her, patting her cheek and kissing her again before withdrawing. “We'll have plenty of time to celebrate this evening. I’ll help you get dressed.”

Everyone has their little quirks and idiosyncrasies. One of Sashuan's, Jasmine's noticed, is that she almost never asks permission. Never asks what anyone wants. She just makes up her own mind about what's best for you and acts, your feelings be damned. It's exactly the kind of thing that makes Jasmine's blood boil, all the more so for how often Sashuan seems to be exactly right about everything. But though she'd never admit it aloud, the way her partner treats her makes her feel *wanted* in a way no one else ever has.
