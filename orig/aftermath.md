# Aftermath

Savren starts at the gentle rap on the door of her little hospital room, her right hand moving instinctively towards a gun that isn’t there. She closes her eyes, taking a deep breath. “C-come in,” she manages, trying to calm her suddenly pounding heart.

The door opens, and an unfamiliar woman pokes her head into the room. She’s short, even for one of the People, with a kindly face and eerily blue eyes, her long golden hair falling loosely around her shoulders but for one braid on her left side, held togther by a pair of green beads. She’s dressed in in a green-gray _rancal_ with full-length leggings. Savren doesn’t need to read the stylized text on her armband to know she’s with the Shevran.

“Savren Shalsheni Hasciti?” the woman asks gently.

Savren nods. “That’s me.”

“May I enter?”

“Of course.”

_“Vala solliv ashi aftare._” The woman inclines her head, doffing her beret and stepping inside. She closes the door behind her. “I’m Mediator Meduin Nuspani Soshpiri,” she says, stepping closer to the hospital bed and touching Savren softly on the arm. “It’s good to finally meet you.”

Weakly, Savren returns the gesture. “Here to brutally interrogate me and see if I’ve been contaminated by foreign ideas, ma’am?” she replies teasingly.

Meduin looks mortified. “No! Certainly not! I’m so sorry if I gave that impre—”

“Joking, joking.” Savren smiles up at her. “It’s good to meet you too, ma’am. I just wasn’t expecting a visit from the Shevran?”

“I hope I didn’t startle you too badly, then.” Meduin pulls up a chair, seating herself at Savren’s bedside, glancing briefly at the heart rate monitor. “How are you faring, commander? And please, call me Medi.”

Savren looks down. “…as well as can be expected,” she murmurs.

“The surgeon shared some of the details of your… trauma.” Meduin folds her hands in her lap, tilting her head slightly. “Is your pain adequately controlled?”

Savren nods. “Yeah, I’m— I’m fine. I’ve been hooked up to a fent drip since I got here. Bit out of it but no complaints.”

“That’s good to hear. Has the staff been treating you well? Conducting themselves professionally, attending to your needs?”

She nods again. “They’ve been wonderful.”

The mediator makes a quick note on her slate. “Good. Our war heroes deserve the best we can offer.”

It takes Savren a moment to process the implication. “Did you just— are you calling me a—”

Meduin smiles teasingly. *“Everyone* is calling you a war hero, commander.”

“I— I’m not— all I—”

“All you did was keep your people alive through a year of torture, abuse, and… *degradation*, organize a resistance movement from within an enemy labor camp, survive nightmarish conditions of malnourishment and exposure, and singlehandedly save hundreds of lives during a desperate battle to extract the camp survivors. By risking your own life.” Meduin squeezes her hand gently. “Not to mention how you got those wounds on your back in the first place.”

“…how did you—”

“I spoke with Tenuan-_surin_ yesterday. He told me the camp guards were about to torture some poor, starving teenage girl for stealing bread and you intervened, begged them to take you instead.”

“Well.” Savren looks away, her cheeks reddening with embarassment. “I… may have done… *something* along those lines—”

“The girl you saved, Heather — she asked me to pass on her thanks, by the by.”

Savren stares at the mediator, narrowing her eyes. “What are you, my biographer now?”

Meduin laughs. “In a manner of speaking. I’ve been compiling the after-action reports for this engagement.”

“…isn’t that a military matter?”

Meduin nods. “Ordinarily. TRICOM is conducting its own review of the incident, but given the magnitude and… gravity of your situation, the Shevran has put me on cleanup detail for the citizens involved.”

“Nobody from TRICOM has interviewed me yet.”

“I’ve been holding them at bay.” Meduin gives her a slightly embarassed smile. “You do realize you are about to become a centerpiece of Allied war propaganda, yes?”

Savren blinks, then her eyes widen. “…oh.”

“I thought it best to give you a little warning before the vultures descend.” Meduin pats her on the shoulder. “Your face is going to be on posters, and that’s not something you just drop on someone.”

Savren squeezes her wrist nervously, her voice suddenly small. “They’re… going to take pictures?”

“You remember that series they had of ‘The Deathless Lieutenant,’ surely?”

Savren makes a face. “Didn’t they have her posing in a circle of shackled war criminals?”

“Well. Only the ones in the front were actually war criminals. The rest were just actors.”

Savren looks down at her battered, emaciated body. “I don’t… I really don’t want anyone taking pictures of me like this.” She grits her teeth. “It’s bad enough that I’m going to have those marks on my back for the rest of my life, always there to remind me—”

The mediator takes her hand gently. “And *this* is exactly why I’ve been holding them off. You’ve been severely traumatized. You need time to recuperate before Bullmoose and his boys put you back in armor and start snapping photographs.”

“…armor, right.”

“What were you expecting?”

“Well. I mean. Didn’t they have Melody pose shirtless for the ‘Deathless Lieutenant’ series?”

Meduin laughs lightly. “She had quite the physique, you must admit.”

Savren flushes. “…y-yes. Yes, I must.”

Before either of them can speak, there comes another rap on the door. Savren bolts upright, the monitors chirping in alarm as her heartbeat accelerates. Catching herself, she clenches her fists, exhaling roughly, now too embarassed to lay back down. “Come in!” she calls, voice quavering. Meduin holds her hand tightly.

The door opens and Otter steps into the room. Meduin stands respectfully and Savren breaks into a relieved smile as soon as she sees his face. “You’re back!” she cries in Zia Ţai.

“I’m back!” Otter beams at her, latching the door behind him. “I’m sorry, am I interrupting—?”

Savren glances at Meduin.

“I will be asking you somewhat… personal questions,” Meduin says in Ranuir. “If you feel comfortable answering them in front of…?”

_“Cirlen elente, san,”_ Otter quickly interjects, inclining his head. Meduin stares at him.

“You… can speak our language?”

“Oh, yes, ma’am. A little bit. Ma’am.”

“I taught him,” Safris explains. “Cirlen here was with me from the start.” She beckons and he drops his bag, hurrying to her bedside. She grabs him by the tunic and pulls him close, kissing him tenderly on the lips and looking up at him lovingly. “Ciri, this is Mediator Meduin.”

“How do you do.” Meduin smiles at the blushing boy. “You, er— your people shake… hands, yes?”

“The Empire, yes.” Otter grins and touches her gently on the shoulder. *“My* people, no.”

“Oh!” Meduin quickly returns the gesture. “I… must admit, I’ve never seen one of your color so familiar with our customs.”

“To be fair, you’re Shevran,” says Savren. “You don’t interact with them all that much, do you?”

“…I suppose not; you have a point.”

“…Shevran?” Otter looks back and forth between them, alarm in his eyes. “Are… are you in some kind of trouble?”

“Very, very deep trouble.” Meduin ruffles Savren’s hair idly, eliciting a yelp of indignation. “Your girlfriend here has made herself something of a war hero, I’m afraid. I’m doing what I can to buy her time, but, well—”

“Stars and skies, how eager *is* Bullmoose to get his hands on me?” Savren asks, fussing in total futility with her hair. “You make it sound like the Propaganda Division has laid siege to the hospital.”

“Just about.” Meduin sits back down, motioning for Otter to do the same. “The camps have been weighing heavily on morale and you’re exactly what he needs to turn that around.” She clears her throat. “So let me get this straight — quite apart from your more ordinary heroics, you’ve also acculturated a charming Zyahua boy and *taught him the Speech?* All while being brutalized in a fucking *death camp?”*

“I am… aware that could be construed as a violation of shevret,” Safris replies carefully.

Meduin takes a deep breath. “You are far from the first wounded warrior I’ve interviewed, Savren Shalsheni, but you are by far the most *impossible*. I will refrain from mentioning the… *Cirlen matter* anywhere Bullmoose might catch wind of it until you’re ready to face the flashbulbs. The both of you.”

“I’m sorry, ma’am, but who’s Bullmoose?” Otter interjects, clasping his hands together anxiously.

“Bullmoose Voidhammer, director of propaganda for TRICOM,” Meduin replies. “Have you seen those posters up all over, with the… very large fonts and pictures of shirtless soldiers in triumphant poses?”

Otter nods. “He makes those?”

“Directs them, anyway. Very… *enthusiastic* fellow. Subtlety and tact are not, however, his strong suits.”

Savren reaches out and grips Otter’s hand weakly. He leans in close, running his fingers through her hair as she holds tightly to him. “I… appreciate the advance warning, Mediator,” she murmurs, glancing back at Meduin. “Was there something else?”

Meduin nods. “Yes. The main reason I came here was to discuss your disposition post-recovery.”

“Disposition?” Savren blurts out, suddenly anxious. “What is there to discuss? I’ll go back to commanding the Second—”

“Savren-surin.” Meduin’s voice is gentle but firm. “There is no Shalsheni Second. Besides those who were interned alongside you, only two members of the Second survived the Battle of Raven’s Gorge. That means you have five of the thirty-two soldiers of a full company. And even of them… can you imagine sending Tenuan-surin back to the front?”

Savren looks down, silently pursing her lips.

“Your X.O. Vasuen is in pretty rough shape too, although she hides it well,” Meduin continues. “One of the other survivors, Sehtil, had an arm and a leg blown off by a grenade, and she had to be sent to Tel Casran to be fitted with prostheses. She’ll be in physical therapy for years. I—”

“Wait. Wait, wait, wait.” Savren laughs shakily. “Sorry, sorry, this is totally inappropriate, I just— Sehti got a robot arm? *Sehti!?*”

“And leg, yes. Why—”

Savren closes her eyes and leans back. “Old unit joke, long story. Stars in heaven am I glad that girl’s still alive.”

“Alive, yes. Fit for combat, absolutely not, neither mentally nor physically. And neither, for that matter, are you.”

“I know, I know, I can’t just run back out there right now.” Savren waves her away. “Give it a week or two. I’ll heal up, get back into shape—”

“Comrade.” Meduin touches her arm gently. “You sustained grievous bodily and psychological injury during your captivity. You’ve been diagnosed with shanvol. You froze up in the middle of a battlefield—”

Tears are streaming down Savren’s cheeks as she clenches her fists. “F-fuck’s sake!” she blurts, the tension and anger all exploding out of her at once. “It was just— just one mistake, I— wouldn’t you have frozen up too? If they’d— if they’d—”

“If I had been gang-raped by the Imperial Guard?” Meduin finishes quietly. “Of course I would have, comrade. If anything, I most likely would have been significantly more incapacitated in that situation than you were. Your reaction was perfectly normal — you’re a human being, Savren. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, and you should be proud of how quickly you bounced back. That takes real courage and strength.”

“Then why are you telling me I’m not fit for—” She trails off abruptly and buries her head in the pillow, trying to smother her tears.

Otter rubs her back gently as Meduin continues. “This,” she says, “is Savren the soldier talking. Not Savren the commander.”

They sit there in silence for a while. Slowly, Savren pats her cheeks dry, wipes her nose, turns back to stare vacantly at the ceiling.

“I’m sorry, Savren.” Meduin sets her slate down in her lap. “I can only imagine how much this must hurt. But if you were in my position, can you honestly say you’d make a different call?”

Savren shakes her head numbly. “So what now? You knock me down to T-four and haul my ass back to Tel Hascit in the middle of a damn war?”

“That was Nishvir-_roshlas_’ recommendation—”

“Of course it was.”

*“—however,”* Meduin continues, unperturbed, “casualty recomposition of Society units is a matter under the Shevran’s authority, not TRICOM’s, and I don’t want to impose something on you without your consent. It sounds like you really don’t want to go back to Tel Hascit. So let’s talk about alternatives.”

“Alternatives?” Savren glances at her, opening her eyes again. “Like what?”

“Any active combat role is absolutely out of the question, to be clear,” says Meduin. “And if you consent to Nishvir-_surin_’s recommendation, I’ll happily send you home. But the majority of military roles don’t have a primary focus on combat.” She passes Savren her slate. “I could move you to logistics, to administration, to engineering, to the hospital corps. Or I could put you on policing duties — somewhere far, far away from the front, anyway.”

Savren taps idly on the slate. “…if I picked police duty, where exactly would you be willing to send me?”

“Well, let’s see. The PG North is the only state under our direct control planetside, and I’d rather not send you outside Society lines. Other than the Provisional Government… the People’s Republic of Westcastle has signed on to the Joint Forces Protocol, and I suppose I could look for a posting there, although they’re a little bit touchy about military police. Can’t say I blame them after their experiences with the Imperial Guard.”

“Wait. ‘Planetside?’” Savren sits up sharply. “Going offworld is an option?”

“Of course.” Meduin nods. “Ideally I’d have you sent straight back to Tel Hascit, but anything that gets you off this bloodstained rock is an improvement in my book.”

“W-what about Topaz?”

“Topaz? Why?”

“My girlfriend is serving there, in the Shalsheni Third.” Savren taps a few keys on the slate, pulling up the theater report and passing it back to Meduin. “The Empire’s pulled out and the Third is just on peacekeeping duties, last I heard. Is there any chance I…?”

Meduin gives her a gentle smile. “I’ll draw up the transit papers now.”

“Thank you!” Savren blurts. “Thank you, thank you, thank you— stars above, all that time in the camp— I was so afraid I’d never see her again—”

“Least I could do for a war hero like you.” Meduin winks. “See? The position has its perks.” She looks up at Otter. “What about you, young man? Do you intend to remain planetside?”

“I… um.” Otter smiles nervously. “If… if there’s any way I could go with Savi— i-i-if she wants me, I mean—”

“Of course I want you, you dork.” Savren grabs him by the scruff of the neck and pulls him down for a kiss on the cheek. “Would it be possible for him to travel with me?”

Meduin drums her fingers on her slate for a moment. “I believe so,” she replies. “I’m going to have to coordinate with the Naturalization Authority, and that means probably a few days of back-and-forth with Tel Casran, presuming the damn Rosies don’t take out any more of our comm relays in the meanwhile… but I think I can do it. As your boyfriend, he should meet the qualifications for metic status. I mean, novas above, the boy’s already got his citizen-name and he’s fluent in *Ranuir—*” She pauses. “Sorry, thinking out loud. I’ll get it done, don’t you worry about the details. Cirlen-_surin?”_

“Yes, ma’am?”

“Would you be particularly opposed to getting an identity implant?” She taps the back of her neck. “It’s not obligatory for metics but it has its advantages. It would make it easier to get your status approved, for one thing. The NA *really* doesn’t like handing out passage cards.”

“Is it… safe?”

“Safest procedure in Society space. It’s performed on everyone early on in life; we’ve had a millennium to work out the kinks.”

He glances at Savren, who nods. “Um, that’s— yeah. I’ll do it.”

“You’ll really be one of us now, Cirri,” Savren teases, poking him in the flank. She looks back to Meduin. “What’s going to happen to the Second, though? What about my people?”

“Right now, nothing,” says Meduin. “Your personnel have all been relieved of combat duty and put under T4 status. T5 in the case of Tenuan, I’m afraid to say. If this damnable war ever ends, we’ll all go home and Rantal Shalshen will merge its units and move survivors around as necessary to maintain an organized fighting force. Failing that… I genuinely don’t know. Perhaps we’ll make do seconding survivors to other units in-theater. We don’t really have much protocol in place for this in wartime.” She looks down. “We’ve… never been in a state of total war before.”

Savren swallows hard. “Right. Okay.”

“We’ll keep you in touch with your people, though. Don’t worry.”

“Vasuen will want to accompany me to Topaz.”

“Should I allow it?”

“Yes, please.” Savren hesitates. “Hey, sorry, can I ask you a dumb question?”

Meduin smiles brightly. “Of course!”

“How high up are you, exactly? Like. On the Charter.”

“I report to the Theater Head, who reports to the Sector Head, who sits on the Control Council,” says Meduin. “So, two degrees from the top. Why?”

“I… understand if this is terribly inappropriate but — can you pass a message up the chain for me?”

“What kind of message?”

Savren grits her teeth and sits up, pulling her hospital gown aside and baring the deep red wounds all across her back. “A photo,” she says, her voice shaking, a tremor in her movements. “And tell them— tell them not to treat with the Empress. Tell them this war can’t end ’til Carnelian burns and the Empire is ash. Because I’d rather die in battle than go home to my cozy bed and my cozy commune on my cozy little planet and live out my life there knowing that millions and millions of people are being tortured like this every day. Every goddamn day.” She takes a deep breath. “It wasn’t just PoWs in that camp, Medi. It was their own people. They did this and worse to their own damn people.” She’s choking up now, shaking, her cheeks again wet with tears. “It’s gotta stop, Medi. It’s gotta stop.”

There’s a quiet click as Meduin snaps a photo of Savren’s back with her slate. “I’ll… pass on your message,” she says solemnly, and for the first time Savren hears a note of uncertainty, of unpreparedness in the woman’s voice. “Take care, Savren-surin.”

_“A san, Meduin-surin.”_
