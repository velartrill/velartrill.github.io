> Thank you so much for dropping me a line. You're right: Comrade Lisuan's behavior today was absolutely unacceptable and I've passed this note on to her own counselor. In the meantime, I'll put in to have Niltar's demerits voided as you suggest -- the last thing that poor girl needs to worry about right now is being disciplined for having a _ceshvol_ attack. I'm sorry you had to experience such mistreatment on top of everything else you describe. I'm very worried by Niltar's self harm, so I'd like to drop by tonight and check up on you two; would you be comfortable with that?

> Regarding Cassil's apparent arrest, this is very disturbing news -- all the more so for the fact that I was not informed -- and I'm grateful that you thought to fill me in. I'm doing what I can to track her down and get in touch with the arresting agent, but as I'm sure you know the Shevran isn't the most transparent agency when it comes to paperwork. I wish I had better news for you.
> 
> I hope I'm not overstepping by asking for this, but for Niltar's sake, would you be willing to informally fill Cassil's role as her guardian until our young firebrand is home safe and sound? I would not ordinarily ask, but both women have spoken very highly of you and it sounds like you care deeply for Niltar in your own right; in fact, it sounds like you've already shouldered some of that burden on your own. No wonder Cassil looks up to you!
> 
> Whatever the case, please take care of yourselves, and don't hesitate to reach out if I can be of any assistance in what is obviously an incredibly difficult time. If I hear any updates on Cassil's situation, you'll be the first to know.
