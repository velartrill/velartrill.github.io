Livkir's dorm is an impeccably tidy place. The aura of coziness and tranquility that it seems to give off is enough to affect even Niltar, who's curled up quietly on the sofa under a couple of fluffy blankets, only her reddened eyes and sodden handkerchief attesting to her emotional state. She barely reacts when Livkir sits down next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder, but he's known her long enough to recognize the subtle little shift in her body language that tells him his presence is wanted.

Wordlessly, he hands her a slate, ruffling her hair as she takes it. Her eyes widen as she reads the text.

"You… you wrote my counselor?"

He squeezes her hand. "It didn't look like you were going to. I couldn't let Lisi get away with that, hon."

> _Lif a til, Livcir-shevan:_
> 
> Thank you so much for reaching out. You're completely right: Comrade Lisuan's behavior today was absolutely unacceptable and I've passed this note on to her own counselor. In the meantime, I'll put in to have Niltar's demerits vacated as you suggest -- the last thing that poor girl needs to worry about right now is being disciplined for having a _ceshvol_ attack. I'm sorry you both had to experience such mistreatment on top of everything else you describe. I'm very worried by Nili's self-harm, so I'd like to drop by tonight and check up on the two of you; would you be comfortable with that?
> 
> Regarding Cassil's apparent arrest, this is very disturbing news -- all the more so for the fact that I was not informed -- and I'm grateful that you thought to fill me in. I'm doing what I can to track her down and get in touch with the arresting agent, but as I'm sure you know the Shevran isn't the most transparent agency when it comes to paperwork. I wish I had better news for you.
> 
> I hope I'm not overstepping by asking for this, but for Nili's sake, would you be willing to informally fill Cassil's role as her _vartash_ until our young firebrand is home safe and sound? I would not ordinarily ask, but both women have spoken very highly of you and it sounds like you care deeply for Nili in your own right; in fact, it sounds like you've already shouldered some of her burdens on your own. No wonder Cas looks up to you!
> 
> Whatever the case, please take care of yourselves, and don't hesitate to reach out if I can be of any assistance in what is obviously an incredibly difficult time. If I hear any updates on Cas’ situation, you and Nili will be the first to know.
> 
> Warmest regards,
> 
> Saluin-_virtash_

Niltar stares numbly at the page for a while, then pushes the slate aside.

"You don't look happy."

"She always gets the last laugh."

"What do you mean?"

She stares off into space. "You heard her. 'You'll just go crying to your counselor to get out of it.' Just like always."

"Nili, Lisi just said that to fuck with your head."

"Well, it's true." Niltar hugs her knees to her chest. "I'm supposed to be taking the Oath this year. And I'm still just… acting like a child. Running to my counselor every time something happens so I don't have to grow up and face the consequences."

"That's a fucked up thing to say about yourself, Nil." Livkir squeezes her hand.

"You saw the letter!" Niltar makes a face. "He's 'very worried' and he wants to 'drop by' to check up on me. He wants you to *take care* of me. Every fucking time something happens, I just… I just fucking fall to pieces and everyone else has to go out of their way to help me back up, and protect me from the consequences of my own fucking behavior, and I just—" She clenches her fists, gritting her teeth; Livkir sees tears glistening in the corner of her eyes again, and tries to hug her, but she pushes him violently away. "Is this all I fucking am? All I'm ever gonna be? I'm just a fucking burden and everyone would be better off if I was dead. Useless, stupid, broken, good-for-nothing--"

*"Nili!"* Livkir grabs her hand again and redoubles his grip when she tries to pull away. "That's not-- *nobody* thinks of you that way."

"Lisuan does. Cas probably does too. And Saluin. And you. Let *go* of me!" She struggles to pull away, to no avail. "I'm just a broken fucking *child* everyone has to worry about--"

Livkir pulls her forcefully into his lap, gripping her hands and holding her there as she tries to pull away. "I am not letting go of you until you stop saying horrible things about yourself," he replies, squeezing her tightly. "You are *not* a fucking burden, Nili; I'd be devastated if I lost you, and you know Cas would be too."

Despite herself, she buries her head in his shoulder. "I wish I was dead."

Livkir sighs. "Nobody else does. *Nobody.* You get that there's a *reason* we've all been fighting so hard to keep you alive, right?"

Niltar shrugs, and Livkir feels her tears against his skin. "I'm tired," she mumbles finally, the fight going out of her.

Livkir hugs her again, and softly strokes her hair and neck as she cries in his lap. "I know. Today has been horrible. This *week* has been horrible for you. But you aren't alone. You are loved and you are wanted, whether Cas is here or not."

"I don't deserve you. Either of you."

"Yes, you do." Livkir rests a hand on the side of her neck. "You deserve so much more than that. After all the pain and loneliness you've gone through, you deserve to have comfort, and love, and companionship."

"What if she never comes back, Liv?"

"That is a huge, huge assumption to make." Livkir shakes his head. "I… I don't believe the Shevran would do that. Would just… lock up a 17-year-old ward forever. That doesn't make any sense."

"I'm scared I'm going to have to fall asleep in an empty bed again for the rest of my life."

"Nuh-uh, no. Not gonna happen." He squeezes her neck gently. "I know I'm not Cas, but if you need to fall asleep in someone's arms, I'm here for you."

She sniffles, squeezing her eyes shut and hugging him softly. "Thank you."

"Least I can do." Livkir looks up as he hears the door open, and Shalcas steps hesitantly into the room. "Shay!"

"Hey." Shalcas smiles timidly, shutting and locking the door behind him. "I… I sent the message. I don't know if they'll respond, but--"

"Worth a try, at least." Livkir pats the couch next to him, looking up expectantly. Shalcas glances around the room as he draws closer, and timidly perches on the edge of the couch. "So how'd you end up having a hotline to the Shevran, anyway?"

"Oh, it's… it's not really like that, um." Shalcas clasps his hands. "When they moved us, they gave us all contact points just in case anything… happened, in our new homes. I wasn't really sure why, maybe just to make us feel safer, but if that was all, it worked."

Livkir tilts his head. "Us?"

Shalcas nods distantly. "Oh, yeah. They evacuated the whole *rantal.* It wasn't just me."

Livkir lets out a low whistle. "Stars above -- I've never even *heard* of anything like that."

"Me neither, otherwise." Shalcas stares out the window, toward the vast whitewater rapids rushing past far below. "It was… very bad."

Livkir fiddles with one of his braids. "I'm sorry," he murmurs. "I keep bringing this up -- I shouldn't keep dragging you back through these memories."

Shalcas flashes him a grateful smile. "That's very thoughtful of you, Livk-- uh, Liv. Don't worry about it."

"What exactly did you say in your message, if you feel okay with sharing? *--Relax,* Shay; you look like you're sitting at attention." Livkir slaps the back of the couch with his palm. _"Sol vali solte asha."_

Shalcas gives him an embarassed smile, and leans back against the cushions. "Sorry, I-- I just-- I'm… I don't know."

"You're not intruding, Shay; really, you're not." Livkir gazes at him with both concern and interest. "You're really worried about upsetting me, aren't you?"

Shalcas bites his lip, and nods slowly. "You've just been so kind to me, and I don't want to mess up the first friendship I've had in-- in a very long time and I'm scared I'm going to do something wrong and piss you off--" He flinches at a quiet beep from the slate sitting on the table, muscles tensing, eyes darting back and forth for a moment before settling on the glow of the slate's screen. "--s-sorry, what was I even saying? Probably nothing important--"

Livkir's brow creases as he reaches for the slate. "You okay?"

"What? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."

"Do you want me to turn off the message noises?" Livkir glances momentarily at the alert before dismissing it and looking worriedly up at Shalcas. "I'm so sorry it freaked you out like that--"

"It's fine, really. Anyway, you wanted to know about the message I sent, right?" Shalcas pulls his legs up onto the couch and turns to face Livkir, who nods slowly.

"Uh, yeah. Yeah, um, what did you tell them exactly?"

"I tried to really focus on, y'know, what it's doing to Niltar to have her _vartash_ yanked out from under her. Shevran people, you know, they don't really respond well if you challenge them, but if you frame it as more like, hey, here's this problem with the system that you can fix -- that gets their attention."

Livkir nods. "Okay. Right. That makes sense -- we're so lucky to have you, Shay. I don't know what we would have done otherwise."

"Thank you," Niltar whispers, not opening her eyes or moving her head from where she's resting against Livkir's shoulders.

"W-well," Shalcas stammers, cheeks reddening, "d-don't thank me yet, you two -- I just hope it has some kind of effect." He shakes his head. "They should never have done this in the first place. Do you have any idea what they took her in for?"

Livkir sighs, turning his gaze toward the peak of Mt. Serenity in the near distance; warm tropical rain is beginning to spatter against the windowpane. "I can probably guess. Cas has been getting in a lot of trouble lately. She keeps mouthing off at the wrong people, skipping classes, posting really insubordinate shit on the local subnets. I've lost count of how many times the Homeguard's had her flogged or put to the wire, and every time it just… she's just worse every time. Volatile and upset. Lashes out a lot. Especially toward her superiors."

Shalcas winces. "That's… not good."

"I keep trying to tell her she needs to work on her temper. There's appropriate channels for this stuff, you know? You don't just go online and call the RSC a 'diseased pack of meddling Casrani barbarians' in front of half a dozen people."

"Did… did she actually *say* that?"

Livkir nods. "She did. Among other things. She even tried to organize a discharge petition campaign after that latest rationing edict came down. I was surprised a flogging was *all* she got that time."

Shalcas purses his lips, staring at the floor. "What exactly did she expect? The Valley is where most of our food is coming from still; the arability crisis is causing shortages throughout the continent." He shrugs. "We can't just not do our part when all the other regions are going to bed hungry," he finishes quietly.

Livkir's eyebrows rise. "You know a lot about that stuff?"

"Huh? Oh, I started an agronomy apprenticeship last year." Shalcas laughs awkwardly. "I probably spend too much time reading the ag digests."

"Agronomy, huh? They have me in Network Management."

"Oh!" Shalcas' eyes light up. "Like, learning to write systems code and things like that?"

"Yeah, exactly. "

"How's it going—?" He interrupts himself, laughing awkwardly. "That's a silly question, everyone knows you're good at everything—"

"Good at—? N-no, I'm— that's just silly." Livkir reddens. ""


"I did a bit of that when I was younger. Before I was moved here. "
