> Hey, Livkir,
> 
> Thank you so much for dropping me a line. You're right: Comrade Lisuan's behavior today was absolutely unacceptable and I've passed this note on to her own counselor. In the mean time, I'll put in to have Niltar's demerits voided as you suggest -- the last thing that poor girl needs to worry about right now is being disciplined for having a _ceshvol_ attack. I'm sorry you had to experience such mistreatment on top of everything else you describe. I'm very worried by Niltar's self harm, so I'd like to drop by tonight and check up on you two; would you be comfortable with that?

> I hope I'm not overstepping by asking for this, but for the meantime, for Niltar's sake, would you be willing to informally fill Cassil's role as her guardian until our young firebrand is home safe and sound? I would not ordinarily ask, but both women have spoken very highly of you and it sounds like you care deeply for Niltar; in fact, it looks like you've already shouldered a some of that burden on your own. No wonder Cassil looks up to you!
> 
> Whatever the case, please take care of yourselves, and don't hesitate to reach out if I can be of any assistance in what is obviously an incredibly difficult time. If I hear any updates on Cassil's situation, you'll be the first to know.
