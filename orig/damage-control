Livkir's dorm is an impeccably tidy place. The aura of coziness and tranquility that it seems to give off is enough to affect even Niltar, who's curled up quietly on the sofa with a couple of blankets on top of her, only her reddened eyes and the wastebin full of damp tissues attesting to her emotional state. She barely reacts when Livkir sits down next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder, but he's known her long enough to recognize the subtle little shift in her body language that tells him his presence is wanted.

Wordlessly, he hands her a slate, ruffling her hair as she takes it. Her eyes widen as she reads the text.

"You… you wrote my counselor?"

He squeezes her hand. "It didn't look like you were going to. I couldn't let Lisi get away with that, hon."

> _Lif a til, Livcir-shevan:_
> 
> Thank you so much for dropping me a line. You're completely right: Comrade Lisuan's behavior today was absolutely unacceptable and I've passed this note on to her own counselor. In the meantime, I'll put in to have Niltar's demerits voided as you suggest -- the last thing that poor girl needs to worry about right now is being disciplined for having a _ceshvol_ attack. I'm sorry you had to experience such mistreatment on top of everything else you describe. I'm very worried by Niltar's self harm, so I'd like to drop by tonight and check up on you two; would you be comfortable with that?
> 
> Regarding Cassil's apparent arrest, this is very disturbing news -- all the more so for the fact that I was not informed -- and I'm grateful that you thought to fill me in. I'm doing what I can to track her down and get in touch with the arresting agent, but as I'm sure you know the Shevran isn't the most transparent agency when it comes to paperwork. I wish I had better news for you.
> 
> I hope I'm not overstepping by asking for this, but for Niltar's sake, would you be willing to informally fill Cassil's role as her guardian until our young firebrand is home safe and sound? I would not ordinarily ask, but both women have spoken very highly of you and it sounds like you care deeply for Niltar in your own right; in fact, it sounds like you've already shouldered some of that burden on your own. No wonder Cassil looks up to you!
> 
> Whatever the case, please take care of yourselves, and don't hesitate to reach out if I can be of any assistance in what is obviously an incredibly difficult time. If I hear any updates on Cassil's situation, you'll be the first to know.
> 
> Warmest regards,

Niltar stares numbly at the page for a while, then pushes the slate aside.

"You don't look happy."

"She always gets the last laugh."

"What do you mean?"

She stares off into space. "You heard her. 'You'll just go crying to your counselor to get out of it.' Just like always."

"Nili, she just said that to fuck with your head."

"Well, it's true." Niltar hugs her knees to her chest. "I'm supposed to be taking the Oath this year. And I'm still just… acting like a child. Running to my counselor every time something happens so I don't have to grow up and face the consequences."

"That's a fucked up thing to say about yourself, Nil." Livkir squeezes her hand.

"You saw the letter!" Niltar makes a face. "He's 'very worried' and he wants to 'drop by' to check up on me. He wants you to *take care* of me. Every fucking time something happens, I just… I just fucking fall to pieces and everyone else has to go out of their way to help me back up, and protect me from the consequences, and I just—" She clenches her fists, grits her teeth; Livkir sees tears glistening in the corner of her eyes again, and tries to hug her, but she pushes him violently away. "Is this all I fucking am? All I'm ever gonna be? I'm just a fucking burden. Useless, stupid, broken, good-for-nothing--"

*"Nili!"* Livkir grabs her hand again and redoubles his grip when she tries to pull away. "That's not-- *nobody* thinks of you that way."

"Lisuan does. Cas probably does too. And Saluin. And you. Let *go* of me!" She struggles to pull away, to no avail. "I'm just a broken fucking *child* everyone has to worry about--"

Livkir pulls her forcefully into his lap, gripping her hands tightly and holding her firmly in place as she tries to pull away. "I am not letting go of you until you stop saying horrible things about yourself," he replies, squeezing her tightly. "You are *not* a fucking burden, Nili; I'd be devastated if I lost you, and you know Cas would be too."

Despite herself, she buries her head in his shoulder.
