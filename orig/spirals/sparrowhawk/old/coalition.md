"Captain Sundancer, I presume?"

The young man is immaculately dressed, and his posture marks a quiet, peaceable confidence that sets him immediately apart. I frown, lowering my drink.

"Afraid you have me at a disadvantage, son."

He bows -- or rather, approximates one in the manner accepted by spacers. "My identity is unimportant. You may call me Wolf if you wish."

*Wow.* "Confident" was an understatement.

"I come to you on behalf of my employers. Might I join you?"

I sweep my hand out, taking my thigh knife discreetly in the other. "Feel free. The cloak-and-dagger has my curiosity sufficiently piqued."

He slips into my cubby, crossing his legs and putting a hand on each knee in an aristocratic posture. "Thank you," he says in a low voice. "I will respect the value of your time and take little of it."

"Who are these mysterious 'employers,' if you can tell me without killing me?" I swish my drink idly in its globe. "Or is this the kind of deal where you drop ominous hints until I figure it out for myself?"

He laughs politely. I take an instant disliking to him. I would have expected a wolf to be less obsequious.

"That is no great secret, mistress. I serve at the pleasure of the Evening Blossom Coalition."

I cock my head. He seems unperturbed by the dagger at his throat.

"That so?" I ask amiably.

"Indeed." He takes a brooch from his robes, holding it up to the light. It's their distinctive obsidian-in-ruby inlay, all right. I kick myself for not noticing it immediately. "I take it you do not require convincing."

"When a man confesses murder, the justiciars ain't often skeptical."

He smiles, seeming a touch more genuine now, though perhaps he's simply attuned my wavelength. He returns the brooch to his robe. "I see our reputation proceeds us. Tell me, if I sought to do you harm, "

"It has recently come to the attention of our little group that circumstances have induced you to relinquish a Morningstar platinum membership."

I stare, dumbfounded. "*You're* the ones bought out their old slot?"

He inclines his head.

*"Wow,"* I breathe. "Crane must be *desperate.*"

"So you haven't heard?" He raises an eyebrow.

"Listen, kid, I've been away some seasons. Ain't full back in the loop quite yet."

"I am happy to 'read you in,' as they say, if this would please you. This is among the services we provide."

"It would," I say, readying myself to memorize every detail. I'll find time to interrogate Daisy later and compare their tales. Oftbetimes a liar will tell you free more than an honest woman will for pay.

"Lotus has fallen upon difficult times of late. Not long ago an altercation of some significance took place in the Silent Crescent public house--"

I stiffen. "They shut that place down, I saw."

He inclines his head. "Your pardon, mistress. I would not contradict you. However, I fear, there was very little left to be shut down."

"Damn. I almost feel bad for the owner."

"The Syndicate compensated her quite generously, I understand."

"Raven's people were mixed up in this? First Empress, what *happened?*"

"Mistress Starsoul *herself* was involved. Centrally, as I understand."

I shiver. "Okay, *what?"*

"The details are not wholly unambiguous. I will share with you the view our organization has taken of the matter, though I will first caution you we have drawn certain conclusions, and I do not intend for you to take our interpretation as authoritative." He leans back, steepling his hands in his lap. "It first became apparent aught was amiss when the station was unexpectedly boarded in contravention with usual procedure and norms of lawgiving. What was at first taken for a truly audacious slaver raid proved to be something else entirely. The attackers were the coterie of a local justiciar, who had come in person to lead the assault. It appears the target of their raid was Mistress Starsoul and her employees."

I draw a sharp breath. "You're telling me the gowns finally dropped the hammer and came for her in force?" My eyes unfocus slightly. "And she's *still here?*"

"The attackers were routed quite soundly, as I understand. The lack of collaboration with station security proved fatal, as security personnel, not knowing the attackers were in the lawful right -- or so is the pretense, I understand the matter was contested quite vigorously thereafter -- acted forcibly to repulse the incursion, unwittingly in concert with the Syndicate's own efforts."

*Unwittingly.* Yeah, right.

"So there was a *pitched battle* in that dismal little pub?"

"No, mistress. The battle ranged across much of Sections Primrose and Cinderbloom."

"That… that can't be right. I seen scarce a tell of damage. You're telling me this happened less than a season ago? The bar can't have been the only casualty."

He smiles. "Indeed. The bar was where Mistress Starsoul chose to indulge her flair for the dramatic. Per local accounts, she made a public appearance mid-battle, and challenged the justiciar to single combat, offering her the chance to spare her women and settle the matter conclusively with a duel."

I whistle softly. "That is the most Raven thing I have ever heard. Wow." I shake my head. "Brilliant. Brilliant and cruel. The gown didn't take the offer, did she?"

"Indeed not. I suspect she did not think much of her chances against a duelist with such an… unnaturally prolongated history of experience with the sword. Particularly in null-grav. Rather than risk herself, she ordered her women to press the attack."

"And they overheard the challenge, didn't they." I shake my head. Raven on one side, the gowns on the other. I can't decide which side I should be taking.

Sometimes you just have to sit on the sidelines, chewing *bai due* and catcalling the prettiest thugs.

"It was broadcast over much of the station, as was the Justiciar's choice to dishonor herself. This is the point at which total chaos appears to have ensued. Some Justicariat troops deserted or mutinied outright. A small majority fought by their Justiciar's side, but they were quickly crushed." He smiles faintly. "They were apparently unprepared to combat a coordinated group of armed men. Rather embarassing, I must say." His smile this time is appropriately wolfish, I reluctantly concede.

I drum my fingers. "What became of the gown?"

"That is unclear. No trace of her remained once the dust had settled. The Justicariat claims she evacuated to safety, but…" He lowers his voice and leans closer. Speaking of a 'flair for the dramatic.' "Our intelligence suggests she has not been seen since the day of the attack. She is either dead—"

"--or in Raven's custody." I shiver.

He nods, drawing back. "The aftermath was, if anything, more significant than the battle itself. The Syndicate made a public show of compensating all those who lost property or kin during the fighting, and the Lady Lunarch took the Justicariat before her peers, demanding compensation and an apology for an action she insisted was without the law."

"Wow. That can't have gone well for her."

"Indeed. She was toeing untested waters; it has never been clear whether the authority of a Gathering supercedes the authority of a Jury, and whatever they might have personally thought of the matter, the local Blood were too prudent to find out for themselves. None desire the attention of her Radiance upon them."

'Prudent.' That's one word for it.

"So she didn't get her compensation money. If the damage was as severe as you say, how did she--" It hits me and the pieces all fall into place. *"Oh.* Shit. *Shit!"*

"As you say." Wolf inclines his head. "It appears Mistress Starsoul loaned a startling sum of sovereigns to her Ceaseless Vigilance the Lady Voidblossom, to repair damage that would have ruined her family otherwise."

"She was actually dumb enough to take a *loan* from the galaxy's most famous *loan shark?*" The Blood, I *swear.*

"As I understand it, Raven forgave the loan after the suit fell through."

"What?" I blurt, floored. "Fuck. Oh, fuck. Voidblossom is *owned* now."

"It was always suspected that the two had some fashion of… mutually productive arrangement. This would seem to be the reason for the Justicariat's unannounced action. However, the apparent public confirmation of the Lady Lunarch's involvement with Mistress Starsoul has injured her reputation grievously. This, and the trauma of the battle, led numerous Houses and chartered concerns to withdraw."

"Fortunate for you."

"Mistress Starsoul was also quick to point this out."

I rub my forehead. "God's tits. You have dealings with *her?* Of course you have dealings with her."

"The Syndicate was… persuaded that we require no additional protection, let us say."

I raise my eyebrows. "I thought you wanted me to put my dagger away."

"I favor no particular policy in that arena." He gives me a fey little smile, and, God within help me, a grin escapes my traitor lips.

Those that remain are local entities and…" He smiles. "Those smart enough to perceive an opportunity when it presents iself."


"I'm out." I flip in the air and kick off towards the entrance hatch. And he just laughs.

"No, you're not," he says mildly, in that *fucking* voice of his, so smug, so confident and amused, and he's not calling my bluff, because I was deadly fucking serious. No, it's not a prediction, it's a command.

I grit my teeth as I find myself reaching out to arrest my momentum, hating myself just a little bit.

It's been how many years? And he *still* has his hooks in deep.

"And what makes you so certain of that?" I say, gazing longingly towards the hatch, knowing immediately what his answer is going to be.

"You sure don't look like you're going anywhere."

Damn that boy.

"Turn your perky little ass around and come back over here, Spar," Rowan continues, a little note of glee slipping into his voice as he continues, "We have *business* to discuss."

*Damn* him.

I sigh, and turn around.

"We do, now, do we?" I ask, fixing him with the most scathing expression I can muster.

Of fucking *course* he's mixed up in all this.

If only I'd seen it.

*Because you never would have come otherwise?* taunts the cheeky little part of my soul that lies beyond the power of my treasured delusions.

Shut it, you.

I think what gets me the most isn't even how easy he can still push me around. What gets me is how he *knew* he could still do it.
