-- whenever we were about to meet anyone of significance, Kestrel would always, just before they entered the room, whisper to me some unseemly detail of the woman's private life, some dark little secret that the tabloids would pay for in blood and platinum, words that could unmake decades -- sometimes centuries -- of achievement and destroy overnight a family name. she told me in her later years that it was always her design to keep any of the haughty grandeur with which those of the Court always carry themselves from impressing itself too greatly upon my developing psyche. "When you look a fine Nebularch in the eye," she said, "I don't want you to see the gleaming gems, the gaudy hat, the cringeing slaves -- I want her still half-dressed in her courtly robes, bending her maids over bannisters and fucking them 'til they bleed, all the while beating them with her sandals and screaming, *take that, Lady Nightingale*." *these people are beneath us, Raven,* she refrained from saying, in words so clear I heard them anyway -- *i could not chance the risk that you might ever take them seriously.*

it was, too, harsh training in the art of restraining one's girlish giggles in the presence of magnates.

"You're going back there?"

"I must. My absence would be entirely too conspicuous. The only means by which we have any hope of escaping this place is if I can buy us time. They must believe you dead, and myself above suspicion. The truth will out in time; if we are still within the bounds of the Core when this transpires, we are the both of us dead women walking."

Lishuen squeezes her hands together. "Sorry, I… I know you're… of high rank, I just… the thought of willingly returning to that place—"

"I understand entirely. I will be safe, I assure you. My record up unto this point is flawless; I am trusted of the Empress herself. It will take time for them to consider the possibility I have turned traitor, certainly more so than one day. Longer still for her Radiance to admit the possibility. And one day is all we will require."

"You have a ruse in mind?"

I laugh. "My dear, I sit on the Privy Council. At my level, one plans each footstep a fortnight in advance -- six, if she steps against the sovereign."

"I see." Lishuen folds her hands in her lap. "Am I to… await you here?"

"You seem uncomfortable with the prospect."

"I… don't like being alone. I don't know what might happen, I--"

"This is the retreat of a Vizier, my darling. It is guarded day and night, and the slaves will attend you as faithfully as though you were me."

"Can they be trusted, all of them?"

"Those who I could not keep in my confidence, I found excuses to sell or transfer to my townhouse many days hither. Those who remain are loyal to me personally, and all have ample reason to despise the Empire."

"If you say so." Lishuen is plainly unhappy with the idea.

"Before I depart, however." I touch her softly on the shoulder. To my wonderment, she doesn't even flinch. "I will have need of your services."

"How so?"

I step back, clasping my hands behind my back. "I must have you injure me."

*"Wh-what?"*

"I require an excuse to be quit of my duties for a time. It is against my character to take vacations. Appearing before my subordinates battered and bruised will in addition further dispend of any suspicions that might be raised against me."

Lishuen stares at me. "I… I can't. You've… you've been so kind to me, you saved me, I--"

"And if you wish to *stay* saved, you will rouse yourself and overcome this pitiful emotional block," I respond, momentarily reverting to my courtly persona. "Are you not a soldier of the Adversary, Lishuen? Your kind is made of sterner stuff than this."

Lishuen flushes, closes her eyes, inhales deeply, digs her fingernails into her arm again. "I'm sorry. You're right; I'm being childish."

"It is understandable." I beckon. She nods. She's still wobbly on her legs but she's able to stand on her own without clutching the chair.

"What should I…?"

"Use your best judgment. It ought be something noticeable even under my full robes, however. And do not break any bones that my mobility depends upon; we will need every advantage to escape this place."

"So… something on your face or lower arms."

I nod. "Tell me no more. If this is too carefully planned, we may leave some sign of our intent."

"I understand." She steps closer, her hand forming a fist. "I… I'll try not to hurt you any more than I have to."

"Get that soppy, bedamned emotion out of your voice, girl." I spread my arms, pulling back my sleeves to reveal the intricate spiral scars that stretch from the back of my palms to my shoulders. "I took my _ting giau ţú_ without opium or tears; if you think a simple battering will break me, you underestimate me severely."

At the sight of the marks, Lishuen inhales sharply. "I've… I've heard of _giau ţú_ but… this is the first time I've actually seen it." She touches my arm softly. "Stars and skies, this is brutal. How much of your body…?"

"By custom, one decorates the arms and thighs. The back as well, if one is common-born as I am and is not honored with _ţú şèi_. It is currently fashionable at court to extend the process to one's flanks, though the style comes and goes. I remember when I was young it was seen as… showy, but now if one seeks a boon of the Empress and wishes to escape scandal, it is very much obligate."

"Do… do the guards make you take off your clothes so they can check or something?"

"Ah, yes. You are unfamiliar with court custom. I apologize." I incline my head. "A petitioner does not dress in this fashion in the presence of the Empress. Court dress bears much of the body to Her inspection -- to conceal beauty from Her is a great insult, to God and all the Empire. In truth, She cares little for the custom, but in this we are all enslaved of fashion and tradition."

-- "Your Radiance, I must beg of you a favor."

"If it is in my power to grant, you shall have it," She replies immediately.

I gesture to my blackened eye and bruised cheek. "I have done my best to maintain my strength in the presence of my colleagues, but I cannot lie to my Empress. Yesterday's events have lessened me shamefully. To be attacked here in this sacred place… my thoughts are scattered in the wind; my will wavers before a heart that will not cease pounding. No focus can I bring to bear upon my duties. Even my own office has become submerged in a sea of terror, in which I drown, every moment a waking death. I have found respite only by fleeing to the peace of my forest manor, tail between my legs. I do not believe I can long serve the Empire in this state. Ten and ten thousand apologies to your Radiance, that you should have to bear my weakness--"

The Empress smiles softly. "You need a vacation," says She.

I drop my head. "I… aye, your Radiance."

"My dearest Raven." The Empress takes me by the shoulders, looks me in the eye. "For years beyond counting now you have served me faithfully and without rest. You are the only woman on the whole of the Privy Council never to claim a moment of time for your own, and were you not so fearsomely effective, I might well have commanded that you do so long hither. Go! Take however much time you desire; you have more than earned this. And do not even think of returning until you are calmed and whole once more."

"Your Radiance is far too kind." I clasp my hands at my waist. "I… you will send word, will you not, if any matters of urgency arise--"

The Empress laughs. "In the business of Empire all matters are urgent, and weighed in blood. But if it will calm your nerves, I will give you my solemn word that you shall be kept advised of all major developments, should you venture so far afield as the very Fringe or into the Barbarian East."

I bow low. "Thank you. Thank you, your Radiance, ten and ten thousand boons upon your name. I am undeserving of such kindness, such resolute magnanimity--"

"You are perhaps the most deserving of all the Privy Council," She says, and for the first time I feel a flicker of genuine shame. "I shall survey the court, and see you are furnished with a ranked list of the most recommended resorts throughout the Realm. Tell me, dear dame -- have you yet ventured offworld?"

Would that I could betray this Empire without betraying Her.

"I cannot say I have had the privilege, your Radiance."

"Oh, but it is exquisite! Alas, as so involved an undertaking it is yet a rare privilege; I would this were not so. But have we here before us not a grand opportunity? Long have you ably defended our Realm against all fell forces within and without, yet scarcely have you enjoyed the slightest sliver of her glories! What justice is there in this?

"Go, see the Jewelled Forests of Sundered Apex! The God-Peak on Resolute Pearl, the highest mountain in all the Civilized Galaxy! The underwater cities of the Orchardblossom house seat! Or perhaps, go to the East, and see for yourself what our new conquests have brought into my dominion. The Fallen Acropolis of the Whispering Valley -- over six million years old, our archaeologists tell me, and yet still so much intact; I yearn to visit it myself one day, should I find means to tear away for myself the time for such a lengthy voyage. See one, see them all if you would!" She puts a hand to my cheek. "And contemplate as you do, that your touch is on all these wonders. Your fingerprint marks our worlds each and every one. These places all owe their safety and prosperity to your selfless labors."

I nod slowly. "Your Radiance makes a compelling argument. Perhaps… perhaps I will. I am growing old, and it would sorrow me were I to go to the next life not once having seen the stars in their grandeur."

"Then it is decided!" The Empress beams. "Oh, Dame Raven, I do abominate what has befallen you, but as ever I would look to the brighter side of things: if it buys you the will to renew yourself, and perchance teach you the importance of leisure, perhaps we all shall profit yet."

I incline my head. "I do not doubt your wisdom, your Radiance. If only such old habits as mine were easily broken…"

"Aye, you are presently the only Vizier of common birth, are you not? Betimes I forget this. Ah, if only those of the Blood took their duties so seriously, our Realm should rival the Shadows in power and prosperity!" She shakes her head. "Go, daughter. You have my blessing."

I bow again. "I shall depart for the void as soon as I have prepared the Vizierate for my absence." I hesitate. "Your Radiance," I add softly. She does not visibly react -- she knows this tone of voice all too well. Instead she beckons to her hovering slaves, commanding them off on some makework errand, and returns her gaze to me only once the room is cleared. She says nothing, but arches an eyebrow.

"The affairs of last night," I continue, voice low -- "perhaps it is only my addled state of mind, but all the same — I have interviewed the guards, reviewed the documents and evidence time and time again, and my conclusion is unchanged. Certain particulars of what befell us *do not add up."*

"You suspect intrigue," She responds.

I nod. "It is for this in particular I so abominate to leave your Radiance less ably defended. Be you wary, and whomsoever you appoint to hold office in my stead, be you *absolutely certain* of her loyalty."

"This is no small warning, from such a mind as yours. Know that I heed it full and well." She touches me softly on the shoulder. "I bless your name, Dame Raven. Now and always."

I exhale, emoting relief. "And I yours, your Radiance."

That hurt.

That hurt a lot worse than being punched by Lishuen. More easily would I endure the torments of my dungeons than face Her again.
