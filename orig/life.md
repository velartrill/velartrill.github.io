"Kess?"

"Yeah, Bear?"

"The heck is this?"

I turn, reddening as I see the little slip of paper in his grasp. "O-oh. It's— it's something the… the _virtash_ asked me to do."

Bear sits down next to me, inhaling from the tea mug's steam before he sets it down in front of him. "What was that, Kess?" he asks, looking at me gently.

"He…" I rub my upper arms absently; Bear reaches for a blanket. "He asked me to make a list. Of… of 'everyone I saved.'"

Bear gives me that look he does when he thinks I'm being ridiculous, draping the blanket over my shoulders. He grabs the paper and pen, scribbling something on it before handing it back to me. "You can do better than that," he chides.

I glance at the paper. Underneath Sparrow's name, he's written his own.

I crumple, leaning heavily against him, and he puts a warm arm around my shoulder. Just like always. "Hey, now," he murmurs. "What's that about?"

I shake my head. "I'm just… I'm just really overwhelmed right now."
