"Kess?"

"Yeah, Bear?"

"The heck is this?"

I turn, reddening as I see the little slip of paper in his grasp. "O-oh. It's— it's something the… the _virtash_ asked me to do, for some reason."

Bear sits down next to me, inhaling from the tea mug's steam before he sets it down in front of him. "What was that, Kess?" he asks, looking at me gently.

"He…" I rub my upper arms absently; Bear reaches for a blanket. "He asked me to make a list. Of… of 'everyone I saved.'"

Bear gives me that look he does when he thinks I'm being ridiculous, draping the blanket over my shoulders. He grabs the paper and pen, scribbling something on it before handing it back to me. "You can do better than that," he chides.

I glance at the paper. Underneath Sparrow's name, he's written his own.

I crumple, leaning heavily against him, and he puts a warm arm around my shoulder. Just like always. "Hey, now," he murmurs. "What's that about?"

God, I can still remember that week so vividly. That horrible thump when the train derailed. The five-day loaded march to the nearest intact line on the other side of the _den tsuang_ sabotage, hacking our way through untamed wilderness with machetes with guns and food and ammo strapped to our breaking backs. The raucous cheers when that rattletrap troop train finally came into sight, amidst the thunder and torrential rains of a Cascade spring. My tears in the bunk that night, as the train creaked and clattered its way over a nameless bridge. Waking Bear despite fighting so hard to stay quiet — and exhausted though we all were, he just said — "hey now. What's that about?"

I can still remember them all so vividly.

I shake my head. "I'm just… I'm just really overwhelmed right now."
