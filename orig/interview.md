She has no idea how long it's been.

In the bleak, windowless stone cell there is nothing but the cot, a lamp up above casting dim, sterile light through the tiny room, and a heavy metal door without so much as a knob, or even a keyhole. No clock to tell her the time, nothing but the beating of her own heart to tell her it's passing at all. The sheets are far too thin, and she's doubled them up as best she can, huddled shivering underneath to protect her naked, still-wet body from the chill.

She starts when she hears the digital blare and quiet *thunk* of the door unlocking. Her instincts shriek at her to get to her feet, stand at attention; she ignores them. Heart pounding, she fixes her eyes on the door as it slides back, and a figure steps into the cell. A woman. Not particularly tall but well-built; her bare arms are a show of sleek, taut muscle, and her abs are visible even through her uniform.

A uniform Cassil Tegvari recognizes all too well.

Dark, green flex-fabric robes wrap tightly around the officer's body, accentuating the curves of her back and hips, around which is tied a short black sash. A heavy fabric *shevtalven* is strapped across her chest to protect her heart and lungs from blades or bullets; black armbands with white emblems encircle her upper arms. Her legs are covered by silver leggings that reach just below her knees. Elegant leather combat gauntlets, the same color and material as her boots, run from her knuckles to just below her elbow. It's the unmistakable garb of a Shevran footsoldier.

The girl buries her head in the pillow again.

"Cassil, right?" The officer's tones are almost kind; nothing like what Cassil expected from this place. She mumbles something into the pillow in reply.

Footsteps. She cracks an eyelid, turning her head to see the officer kneeling down by the bunk, holding up a neatly folded grey *rancal.* "I brought you clothing," she says gently.

Part of Cassil wants to just turn away, close her eyes, and lay there catatonic until the woman goes away. But the tiny rational part of her that's left knows full well they'll keep her here forever if she doesn't cooperate -- they have all the time in the world, and she's cold, alone, and miserable. Cooperation is her only hope of getting out of here.

And a robe will at least make the chill a bit more bearable.

With a quivering hand she reaches out. Between the terror, fury, and temperature she's shaking like a leaf in the wind; the officer catches her wrist and tugs gently. "On your feet, comrade," she says. It's an order,  but her tone isn't any less kind.

Reluctantly, cheeks burning, Cassil forces herself to stand. As the blankets fall away from her body the cold attacks her with newfound ferocity, and she can barely keep her knees from giving in, can barely control her hands enough to clasp them behind her back.

The officer motions for her to turn, and as she does grips Cassil by the hair, forcing her head down with a fluid, practiced motion. The girl lets out a whimper as a cold steel reader plate is pressed to the back of her neck; she hears a handset chirp. The Shevran goon releases her hair and takes her by the shoulder, tugging lightly until Cassil turns back to face her.

"Cassil Tegvari you indeed are," the woman tells her, holstering her handset and proferring the robe. "Do you need help getting dressed?"

"…who are you?" Cassil demands weakly, taking the robe and trying to wind it about her body, but the tremors keep her from making much progress. "What do you want?"

"My name is Safris," the woman replies, stepping behind Cassil and taking the robe from her hands, winding it quickly about the girl's torso. "And you're being awfully impertinent for someone in your position, don't you think, _shevan?"_ Her tone is light and teasing; no sign of anger or offense.

"Whatever," Cassil responds sullenly, folding her arms. The feeling of fabric on her body again is an enormous relief; despite her detainee greys' meager protection against the chill, she feels… not safe, but infinitely less vulnerable. Calmer, more collected.

Safris takes her by the upper arm, but before Cassil can even open her mouth to protest, her trembling legs give out beneath her and she stumbles. Safris quickly catches her by the waist, helps her back to the bed. "Are you injured?" she asks, sitting next to the girl and touching her on the shoulder.

Cassil shakes her head silently. Tears are streaming down her cheeks now, and she can't meet Safris' gaze.

Safris frowns, tilting her head. "I can summon a medic if you need one—? Or—" She stops as the girl's shoulders begin to shake and Cassil buries her head in her hands. "You're not in very good shape, are you, Cassi?" she says quietly, her tone shifting by several degrees of intimacy.

Cassil just shakes her head, and begins to sob.

Safris scoots closer, puts an arm around Cassil's shoulder, and the girl collapses against her side, eyes and nose already red from crying. With her free hand Safris touches her softly on the cheek, and Cassil rests her head against the other woman's shoulder.

The warmth from Safris' body is enough to drive out the chill, and bit by bit the shivering slows and the tears ebb. When she finally dares open her eyes, Safris takes her by the hands.

"Are you going to be able to walk?" the officer asks. "I can fetch a wheelchair if need be--"

Cassil shakes her head. "I'm f-- I'm fine," she mumbles.

"If you're sure." Safris stands, tugging Cassil by her wrists, and reluctantly the girl gets to her feet. She's unsteady, but Safris takes firm hold of her and guides her to the door. They step through into a small alcove, and Safris nods towards what's probably a one-way mirror on the wall. There's another blare and the second door ahead of them unbolts itself, sliding slowly back to reveal a long dimly-lit corridor outside.

Safris is joined by two further officers outside the cell, one of whom takes hold of Cassil's other arm. The other stays well ahead of them, and the girl notices a sidearm holstered at his thigh.

*What have I gotten myself into?*

The team escorts her through the maze of hallways, past a checkpoint where her identity implant is scanned yet again, and finally into a bleak gray room with a tall ceiling and two chairs on either side of a small metal table — one bolted to the floor. Cassil notices an angled mirror high up along the wall -- almost certainly a one-way window.

Safris and the other woman guide Cassil to the chair and seat her in it. Cassil can't even muster the energy to struggle as they fasten her wrists with a pair of handcuffs bolted to the tabletop -- the wide, padded kind they use when they mean to keep you cuffed for a good long time.

Safris fastens the final strap and steps back, keying her handset. "Clear," she calls, nodding to the other officers, who step back and file out of the room. Safris walks over to the door, clasping her hands behind her back and inclining her head as a tall, lanky figure steps into the room.

"Good evening, Ward Cassil." Cassil fixes her eyes dully on the newcomer as she seats herself across from the girl. The woman is dressed in a uniform like Safris' but without the breastplate or gauntlets -- a bureaucrat, not a fighter. She doffs her beret as she sits, flipping open a laptop with her spare hand, scrutinizing the screen as she speaks. "My name is Seruan. I'm pleased we can finally meet, and I apologize for the delay."

"Just 'Seruan'?" Cassil retorts. "What about your fancy title, *comrade?"*

Seruan doesn't take the bait. "My full title is Shevran Mediator Seruan Fesmadi, if you wish to know," she replies mildly. "May I review the facts of you situation, so as to ensure we are both on the same page?"

Cassil shrugs. "Whatever."

Seruan's gaze turns back to the laptop, the blue light of its screen reflecting in her emerald eyes. "You are Ward Cassil of Commune Tegvar," she begins, "identity code two-six-ten-two-fifteen, age seventeen, "
