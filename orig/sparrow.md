# Sparrow
% by Lexi Summer Hale

I drape my coat awkwardly across the over-full coatrack, absentmindedly kicking the snow off my boots and blinking as my eyes adjust from the blinding white of the sun outside. My feet are cold enough I don't bother to take off my socks, the soft, thick pair that Daisy knitted for me in the Autumnsborough trenches, just days before the battle that took her life. Two years later they're the only socks I have that seem able to hold their own against the cruel chill of a northern winter.

I pad softly down the dark hall, idly rubbing my hands together and breathing deeply of the warm air. As I turn down the leftward corridor into the east wing, I find the door to the guest room ajar, but I knock all the same before I enter. Light from the great picture window spills out into the hallway as I push the door open, that unique sparkling white of a glowing sun reflecting off fresh-fallen snow. Maybe someday I'll be able to see that kind of sunlight again without my heart pounding like a cannon in my chest.

From where I stand I can just see the edge of Cormorant Court through the window, encircled by the high wall of terraced apartments. The great fountain in the center of the memorial walls is frozen solid. A little white cap of snow sits on the head of the statue perched atop it, its wings spread across the heavens and beak towards the sun. Sometimes I think Egret built the memorial here just because she didn't want to see that bird every time she looked out her office window, and truth be told I couldn't blame her. But for all the pain and sorrow that wells up in my heart whenever I look at the thing, there's still something comforting about having it so near. About touching my hand to the cold marble of the walls, tracing my fingers across the lettering of names that were once as familiar to me as Bear's or… or Cormorant's. I've spent more than a few sleepless nights sitting out there, back pressed up against the Ninth's own memorial stone, a cigarette at my lips, staring up into the twirl of snowflakes cascading down from the sky. 

Fantasizing about what I'd say to them all if I could steal away just one more moment with each.

Moose is splayed out across the sofa, a pillow over his head, chest moving gently with the rhythm of sleep. Slowly, I approach the bed next to him. The sheets are even more of a tangled mess than when I left, half the pillows in the house heaped about the frail body of the girl lying there. Her breathing is calmer than it was last night, and the blankets are no longer soaked with sweat. Her head is buried in a pillow.

Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm looking at the same woman I used to know. The fearless, Matikhe-may-care badass who wouldn't hesitate for a moment before taking a flying leap into no man's land and dragging some poor fuck to safety. Who'd grin up at me and crack jokes while I cleaned and dressed her bullet wounds. Who seemed absolutely goddamn invincible.

Until that fucking night.

"Hey," I murmur. She cracks an eyelid.

"…m-ma'am?" she whispers.

I sigh, reaching out and touching her hand softly. She flinches, but doesn't pull away. "How are you doing, Spar?"

She closes her eyes again. "Don't feel so cold no more," she says at length.

"Is the pain feeling any better?"

She nods.

I take a seat next to her on the bed. "I want you to try to sit up for me. Can you do that, Spar?"

She sighs.

I squeeze her hand. "Give it a try. Come on; that's an order, L.T."

Sparrow flinches. "Thought you said the war was over."

"Sure is, but if you're gonna keep insisting on calling me *ma'am—*"

"Don't feel right calling you Kess." With effort, she pulls herself slowly into a sitting position. It's painful to watch, and I have to force myself not to reach out and help her. She's still quivering, but this time it seems to be muscle weakness more than anything else. *Muscle weakness.* God. How is this the same girl who once arm-wrestled *Bear* into submission?

I take a roll of bandages from the bedside table, and unclip my pocketknife from my belt. "I'm gonna change your dressings, okay, Spar?"

"Okay."

I scoot closer. Her arms are thinner than I would once have imagined possible; it's hard to find even a hint of muscle on her battered body. I try to remove the dirty bandages as gently as I can, but she still lets out little mewls of pain as they pull free of her skin. The grisly wounds beneath don't look much different from yesterday, or the day before. I suppose it's just a mercy they stopped bleeding.

"Were you able to get anything down while I was away?" I murmur.

"Threw it up."

I squeeze her hand again. "I'm so sorry."

She doesn't respond; just pulls the blankets tighter around her with her free hand. I catch a tear dripping from the corner of her eye as I work.

"I wish I didn't have to do this to you."

She's silent for a moment. Then: "I wish you'd put a bullet through my head 'stead of bringing me home."

"Spar!" I stare at her, hands faltering. "Spar, don't say such horrible things."

"Shoulda done me like you did Weasel when that mortar got him. Ain't no difference."

For a moment, the gun is in my hand again, the reek of sulfur and death all around me, my friend's blood spattered across my greatcoat. And then before I can so much as scream it's gone. The bandage roll falls from my hand. My chest shudders as I try to breathe in. "Don't," I manage finally, touching Sparrow on the cheek. "Don't, Spar, no. No. This is not the same."

"All I got in front of me is pain, Kess. All I got left."

"That isn't so. Look at me, Spar. We won, alright? There's a whole new world out there and it's on your side." I can't keep the edge of fear and desperation out of my voice. "You've got me, you've got Moose, you've got Bear, you've got Dahlia, you've got all your old comrades here to take care of you. You've got a world full of people here to protect you and look out for you."

"How'm I s'posed to live with myself?" Tears are streaming down her cheeks now. "I ain't got nothin' left to give no one. Just a weak, broken, useless _tsau gian wè_ piece of shit ain't good for nothin' but wasting food and space—"

"*Useless!?*" I grab her by the shoulders. "You are a *God*-damned *hero,* Sparrow Fenwild. You've been giving all your damn life. Isn't it about time you sat the fuck down and let the rest of us show some gratitude?"

"What do you think? If you went and asked any random fuck down at the tavern what he thought of some stupid good-for-nothing bitch getting fat off his work and giving nothing back to no one for it? What do you think he'd say, Kess?"

"You know what, let's go ask!" I stand, glaring down at her. "Let's go to the tavern and I'll find someone to ask. And I'll tell him everything you did for the fight. How many lives you saved. And I'll show him all the scars you got for your trouble. At *age fucking nineteen.* And I'll tell him what they did to you. And I'll ask him what he thinks you're due. 'Cause what do you think he'll say, Spar?"

She looks away.

"You know you're better than that. You know it deep down. You know you're worth more than that. And you know everyone can see it plain. It doesn't matter if you don't do a day's honest work for the rest of your goddamn *life,* Spar, because *you have fucking earned that.* A thousand times over."

"Matters if I want my ration quota," she mutters finally, flopping over. I scoff.

"No. No, we're taking care of that today. You are never going to want for anything again, Spar. So help me God you're *going* to live a long and happy life *whether you like it or not.*" I sit back down next to her, and slice a fresh strip off the roll to bandage her cuts with. "There is so much more than opium and nightmares for you to look forward to. I promise you that."

In the distance, I hear the front door open, and Sparrow's eyes open wide, a pulse of fear shooting through her body. I squeeze her wrist tightly. "It's just Bear, love. You don't gotta worry." I tape the last bandage in place. "There. All done."

Footsteps sound in the hall, and moments later Bear steps halfway into the room, knocking gently on the open door. "Hey there, girls," he calls.

"Who you callin' a girl?" Moose murmurs sleepily, pulling the pillow away from his face.

"Certainly not you, ma'am." Bear slaps him on the shoulder with his free hand as he walks past. In the other he's clutching a hanger, protruding from the top a snowflake-flecked dust sleeve. "Mission accomplished, Kess," he tells me, yanking off the dust sleeve and laying the garment out reverentially on the bed. Sparrow glances back and forth between us, confused.

"Wh-what's-- what's that? What's going on?"

"Technically, you went AWOL," I tell her. "You were never officially discharged from the service." I lift the blue-and-black dress into the air. "So we got you a new dress uniform. Honors and all." I tap the name patch, where "FENWILD" is spelled out in crisp, official Khmai characters. Underneath is a single blue stripe surrounded by white bars. "Figured you should be in uniform for this."

"For… what?"

I pat Bear on the shoulder. "How long 'til the next session starts?"

"Started about ten minutes ago."

"Good. No time to lose then. Give them a ring and let them know to expect us, will you?" I turn back to Sparrow. "We're taking a trip to the Senate."

She stares at me. "Wh-what!? The-- the Senate? Why-- I'm not-- there's-- I--"

I tap the blue stripe on her uniform. "Because *this* is woefully inadequate. Help her get dressed, will you, antlers?"

Moose yawns, nodding. "Roger that."
