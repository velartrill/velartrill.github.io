I drape my coat awkwardly across the over-full coatrack, absentmindedly kicking the snow off my boots and blinking as my eyes adjust from the blinding white of the sun outside. My feet are cold enough I don't bother to take off my socks, the soft, thick pair that Daisy knitted for me in the Autumnsborough trenches, just days before the battle that took her life. Two years later they're the only socks I have that seem able to hold their own against the cruel chill of a northern winter.

I pad softly down the dark hall, idly rubbing my hands together and breathing deeply of the warm air. As I turn down the leftward corridor into the east wing, I find the door to the guest room ajar, but I knock all the same before I enter. Light from the great picture window spills out into the hallway as I push the door open, that unique sparkling white of a glowing sun reflecting off fresh-fallen snow. Maybe someday I'll be able to see that kind of sunlight again without my heart pounding like a cannon in my chest.

From where I stand I can just see the edge of Cormorant Court through the window, encircled by the high wall of terraced apartments. The great fountain in the center of the memorial walls is frozen solid. A little white cap of snow sits on the head of the statue perched atop it, its wings spread across the heavens and beak towards the sun. Sometimes I think Egret built the memorial here just because she didn't want to see that bird every time she looked out her office window, and truth be told I couldn't blame her. But for all the pain and sorrow that wells up in my heart whenever I look at the thing, there's still something comforting about having it so near. About touching my hand to the cold marble of the walls, tracing my fingers across the lettering of names that were once as familiar to me as Bear's or… or Cormorant's. I've spent more than a few sleepless nights sitting out there, back pressed up against the Ninth's own memorial stone, a cigarette at my lips, staring up into the twirl of snowflakes cascading down from the sky. 

Fantasizing about what I'd say to them all if I could steal away just one more moment with each.

Moose is splayed out across the sofa, a pillow over his head, chest moving gently with the rhythm of sleep. Slowly, I approach the bed next to him. The sheets are even more of a tangled mess than when I left, half the pillows in the house heaped about the frail body of the girl lying there. Her breathing is calmer than it was last night, and the blankets are no longer soaked with sweat. Her head is buried in a pillow.

Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm looking at the same woman I used to know. The fearless, Matikhe-may-care badass who wouldn't hesitate for a moment before taking a flying leap into no man's land and dragging some poor fuck to safety. Who'd grin up at me and crack jokes while I cleaned and dressed her bullet wounds, waving away all offers of opium. Who seemed absolutely goddamn invincible.

Until that fucking night.

"Hey," I murmur. She cracks an eyelid.

"…m-ma'am?" she whispers.

I sigh, reaching out and touching her hand softly. She flinches, but doesn't pull away. "How are you doing, Spar?"

She closes her eyes again. "Don't feel so cold 'n sweaty no more," she says at length.

"Is the pain feeling any better?"

"Li'l bit."

I take a seat next to her on the bed. "I want you to try to sit up for me. Can you do that, Spar?"

She sighs.

I squeeze her hand. "Give it a try. Come on; that's an order, L.T."

Sparrow flinches. "Thought you said the war was over."

"Sure is, but if you're gonna keep insisting on calling me *ma'am—*"

"Don't feel right calling you Kess." With effort, she pulls herself slowly into a sitting position. It's painful to watch, and I have to force myself not to reach out and help her. She's still quivering, but this time it seems to be muscle weakness more than anything else. *Muscle weakness.* God. How is this the same girl who once arm-wrestled *Bear* into submission?

I take a roll of bandages from the bedside table, and unclip my pocketknife from my belt. "I'm gonna change your dressings, okay, Spar?"

"Okay."

I scoot closer. Her arms are thinner than I would once have imagined possible; it's hard to find even a hint of muscle on her battered body. I try to remove the dirty bandages as gently as I can, but she still lets out little mewls of pain as they pull free of her skin. The grisly wounds beneath don't look much different from yesterday, or the day before. I suppose it's just a mercy they stopped bleeding.

"Were you able to get anything down while I was away?" I murmur.

"Threw it up."

I squeeze her hand again. "I'm so sorry."

She doesn't respond; just pulls the blankets tighter around her with her free hand. I catch a tear dripping from the corner of her eye as I work.

"I wish I didn't have to do this to you."

She's silent for a moment. Then: "I wish you'd put a bullet through my head 'stead of bringing me home."

"Spar!" I stare at her, hands faltering. "Spar, don't say such horrible things."

"Shoulda done me like you did Weasel when that mortar got him. Weren't no different."

For a moment, the gun is in my hand again, the reek of sulfur and death all around me, my friend's blood spattered across my greatcoat. And then before I can so much as scream it's gone. The bandage roll falls from my hand. My chest shudders as I try to breathe in. "Don't," I manage finally, touching Sparrow on the cheek. "Don't, Spar, no. No. This is not the same."

"Ain't but pain front'a me, Kess. S'all I got left."

"That isn't so. Look at me, Spar. We won, alright? There's a whole new world out there and it's on your side." I can't keep the edge of fear and desperation out of my voice. "You've got me, you've got Moose, you've got Bear, you've got Dahlia, you've got all your old comrades here to take care of you. You've got a world full of people here to protect you and look out for you."

"How'm I s'posed to live with myself?" Tears are streaming down her cheeks now. "I ain't got nothin' left to give no one. Just a weak, broken, useless _tsau gian wè_ piece of shit as ran when the going got tough and ain't good for nothin' but wasting food and floorspace—"

"*Tsau gian!?*" I grab her by the shoulders. "You are a *God*-damned *hero,* Sparrow Fenwild. You've been giving all your goddamn life; isn't it past time by now you sat the fuck down and let the rest of us show some gratitude?"

"What do you think? If you went and asked any ol' fuck sat down at the tavern what he thought of some stupid good-for-nothing bitch getting fat off his work and giving nothing back to no one for it? What do you think he'd say, Kess?"

"You know what, let's go ask!" I stand, glaring down at her. "Let's go to the tavern and I'll find someone to ask. And I'll tell him everything you did for the fight. How many lives you saved. And I'll show him all the scars you got for your trouble. At *age fucking nineteen.* And I'll tell him what they did to you. And I'll ask him what he thinks you're due. 'Cause what do you think he'll say, Spar?"

She looks away.

"You know you're better than that. You know it deep down. You know you're worth more than that. And you know everyone can see it plain. It doesn't matter if you don't do a day's honest work for the rest of your goddamn *life,* Spar, because *you have fucking earned that.* A thousand times over."

"Matters if I don't want my ration quota slashed," she mutters finally, flopping over. I scoff.

"No. No, we're taking care of that today. You are never going to want for anything again, Spar. So help me God you are *going* to live a long and happy life *whether you like it or not.*" I sit back down next to her, and slice a fresh strip off the roll to bandage her cuts with. "There is so much more than opium and nightmares for you to look forward to. I promise you that."

In the distance, I hear the front door open, and Sparrow's eyes open wide, a pulse of fear shooting through her body. I squeeze her wrist tightly. "It's just Bear, love. You don't gotta worry. Ain't no one else with a key to this place." I tape the last bandage in place. "There. All done."

Footsteps sound in the hall, and moments later Bear steps halfway into the room, knocking gently on the open door. "Hey there, girls," he calls. Sparrow exhales.

"Who you callin' a girl?" Moose murmurs sleepily, pulling the pillow away from his face.

"Certainly not you, ma'am." Bear slaps him on the shoulder with his free hand as he walks past. In the other he's clutching a hanger, protruding from the top of a snowflake-flecked dust sleeve. "Mission accomplished, Kess," he tells me, yanking off the sleeve and laying the garment out reverentially on the bed. Sparrow glances back and forth between us, confused.

"Wh-what's-- what's that? What's going on?"

"Technically, you went AWOL," I tell her. "You were never officially discharged from the service." I lift the blue-and-black-leather dress into the air. "So we got you new threads. Honors and all." I tap the name patch, sewn snugly into place, where "FENWILD" is spelled out in crisp, official Khmai characters. Underneath is a single blue stripe surrounded by white bars. "Figured you should be in uniform for this."

"For… what?"

I pat Bear on the shoulder. "How long 'til the next session starts?"

"Started about ten minutes ago."

"Good. No time to lose then." I turn back to Sparrow. "We're taking a trip to the Senate."

She stares at me. "Wh-*what!?* The-- the *Senate?* Why-- I'm not-- there's-- I--"

I tap the blue stripe on her uniform. "Because *this* is woefully inadequate. Help her get dressed, will you, antlers?"

Moose yawns, nodding and bouncing up from the couch. "Roger that. C'mere, hotshot." He beckons to Sparrow, ignoring her complaints as he manhandles her gently out of bed, unbuttoning the oversized pajamas I dug out of a closet for her. The poor thing looks half the size she used to, a pale sliver of a waif of a girl, nothing like the force of nature I remember, all tan, sleek, perfectly disciplined muscle and lazy grins.

We all cleaned the blood and grime of battle off ourselves (and sometimes each other) butt naked in the group showers together so many times that the only remarkable thing about seeing Sparrow in her underwear is how goddamn many scars she has, some in places I don't like to contemplate. I spot a gnarly old bullet wound from the siege of Rookshalter, where I made a total mess digging out a round I figured for sure would be soaked in the usual poisons and venom — it wasn’t, of course, meaning I smashed her up all the worse inside for little more than a souvenir, not that she breathed a word in complaint. But on the whole it's a little hard to tell which ones are battle scars, which ones were torture wounds… and which ones she did to herself. Moose tugs the fresh-tailored uniform down over the girl's quivering shoulders, fastening buckles around the waist and straightening the rank strip. Sparrow catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and starts.

"I… I look… This feels all—"

"See, we can actually afford tailors now," I tell her, taking her by the shoulder and plopping a beret down over her head.

"…I never thought…"

"Them's the fruits of victory, darling," I tell her, imitating Egret. She glares at me, and I feel a slight, giddy rush of triumph at finally getting a rise out of her.

"Swear to God, I will knock you on your ass, ma'a— Kess."

"That's the spirit." I pat her on the back. She glowers. "The day you can take me again I'll throw you a right proper party, deal?"

"Don't think I won't. Not for makin' me think about that _ṕing dú shan wè_ _khudekhbere_ bitch again." Sparrow shakes her head. For a moment, I catch the faintest flash of her old self once more, for the first time I've seen in… years. "Ugh. Leastwise I ain't ever gonna have to listen to *that* voice yammerin' on again. *That* there's some fruits."

I stare at her. "…oh, honey."

"What?"

"You really don't read the news, do you?"

Bear sidles up to me as I finish lacing Sparrow's new boots up tight. "Little bit *too* thorough, weren't ya?" he murmurs, glancing sidelong at the girl. I look up at him.

"Say what now?"

"Ain't barely a bruise to be seen. Not even one little sign of all her battle-damage."

"…yeah, on account of I don't want her getting *infected."* I narrow my eyes, brushing off my hands and getting to my feet. "What are you getting at, old man?"

*"For the Senate,"* Bear whispers, elbowing me. "Y'oughta left some red showing at least—"

That's enough for me to punch him in the shoulder. "God *dammit,* man," I grouse as we file out the front door, falling back from Moose and Sparrow so they don't hear us conspiring. "You're talking like Egret. No, it's worse, you're *thinking* like Egret."

He shrugs. "We all get to live in Wagbeak's world now," he replies mildly.

"See," I mutter, "that is exactly the kind of thinking we could all do with less of."

"You did what you did for a reason, Kess. And you weren't wrong to."

"I will not lower myself."

"You know, Kestrel," Bear says, putting an arm around my shoulder, "sometimes I think you'd rather risk a firefight to take someone out than butter 'em up and push their buttons a bit so's they'll give you all you want with a smile and a handshake."

"Don't say that. I hate risking my men's lives. Air strikes are so much more convenient."

"Whatever you say, ambassador."

The tram is crowded when it pulls up to my little station. Not very many get off, and it looks to be standing room only, but as soon as we climb up the steps into the coach a gaggle of teenage boys scrambles to their feet, quickly making way for us. Their apparent leader, a scrawny, freckled Khmai with a half-burned cigarette stuck behind his ear, doffs his cap to me as we approach, fidgeting nervously.

"Please, miss— don't mind us, go right ahead—"

I pat Sparrow on the shoulder and she practically crumples into the seat, her relief at being off her feet palpable. Moose sits protectively beside her. "It's alright," I tell the kid, waving him away. "We're fine standing. Thank you for sparing her a seat, though."

He bobs his head. "Of course, miss. Er. Commander. Whatever you say."

"That's 'General' to you, boy," Bear rumbles, folding his arms. I roll my eyes.

"Don't encourage them, it's bad enough as it is—"

The boy's eyes widen even further. "*General?*" he blurts, awestruck. Bear nods seriously, ignoring me.

"Didn't you hear? They promoted her, after the Victory Gala—"

*"Okay enough."* I step between the two of them. "Ignore him," I tell the boy, shooting a glare at Bear. "He's just completely full of shit today."

Starry-eyed, the boy nods. "Yes sir! Ma'am. General. Um. Yes ma'am." It's all I can do not to cringe at his flailing attempt at a salute. "And— and thank you, ma'am— for— for everything you—"

I make a shooing gesture and turn back to Bear, who's smiling innocently at me. "If you'd made this much trouble for the *enemy* we would have won the damn war and been home in time for the harvest, you know."

"Aw, I couldn't have done a thing like that to Spar," Bear replies easily. "She was just hitting her stride. Still had way too much heroism to get out of her system."

The city's arranged in three concentric circles. Security Districts is the fancy name for them, but nobody actually says that, not even the officers at the checkpoints. There's the Outer Ring, the Inner Ring, and the Garden Circle. How far in you can get depends on what kind of name you've made for yourself. Getting into Stormvale in the first place is no mean feat, but if you want to get past the Outer Ring, you're gonna have to work for it. As for the Garden Circle, well--

The tram stops at a checkpoint station and we all dutifully disembark. Most of the remaining crowd disperses; I catch sight of the boys scampering off towards Fiddleside. Office brats, probably. The place is lousy with clerks. A few of us remain, gathering into a line in front of the low, blocky building that protrudes from the wall.

"Please, go ahead." "Commanders first!" "No, no, after you, mistress Winterblossom." At the sight of my face, everyone trips over themselves to move out of our way, beckoning us to go in front of them. In ordinary circumstances I'd feel embarassed, but this time I'm just grateful the shivering junkie doesn't have to stand outside in the snow. We step through into the security station, where a soldier starts to ask for my ID and then cuts himself off short.

*"—General!"*

The entire building is filled with frantic salutes. One soldier is in such a hurry to stand at attention that I hear a mug clatter and spill on the floor. Out of habit I glance around in search of familiar faces, but find none. "At ease, boys and girls," I tell them, waving them gently away. "The surprise inspection isn't until sundown."

Building comfort and camaraderie was so much easier before my picture was plastered over every other wall on the planet. Back then everyone expected me to prove myself, to earn their respect. Now they're trying to prove themselves to me, and it's a rare day I hear sincere laughter at my jokes, even the good ones. Everyone just says and does what they think I want to see, and unless they served alongside me it never seems to occur to them that I might not be big on superficial flattery.

"Very good, ma'am," is all I get out of the lieutenant in charge, who rushed immediately to the front of the station to greet me, and while his hand drops from his brow, his posture doesn't shift. "Your orders, ma'am?"

"Just passing through. Open the gates, would you?" I gesture to my comrades in arms. "They're with me."

He salutes, turns, and snaps his fingers at the soldiers manning the inspection lanes. There's the metallic clatter of turnstiles unlocking, and the lieutenant steps back, bowing and gesturing towards the lanes. "You're free to pass, ma'am. It's been an *honor*, ma'am!"

"Likewise, lieutenant." I pat Sparrow on the shoulder, ushering her through ahead of me. The soldier in the inspection booth gives the uniformed waif a bemused look as she passes, and the color drains from his face as I fix a glare on him. *Show some damn respect.*

You can tell how seriously the central government takes security here by the terminals in each inspection stall, symbols glowing blue on their little phosphor-matrix screens. We've made some advances with the help of our new friends, but installing a network-capable computer in every guard station and hooking them into the ISB's systems for live access to government databases is still no small undertaking. Neither is training a bunch of jarheads to use the damn things, even if they'd manned the stations with Khmai alone instead of any the other tribes, the lot of us all but entirely illiterate even in our own ethnic scripts. Even with my scribal training, keying text into a terminal is a painful slow process.

We emerge from the checkpoint into the Garden Circle. A fresh tram — one of the fancy new models the senatorial elites called first dibs on — is waiting for us, its passengers emptying out through the exit lane. Given first choice, we all head instinctively towards the back, where cover is plentiful and we can survey the rest of the enclosed coach with ease. You can take a soldier out of the war, but I'm not so sure about taking the war out of the soldier.

The seats are large and well-padded, with high reclining backs of the sort that would doubtless find an enthusiastic audience among elderly scholars with frail bones and ache-prone necks. Sparrow sinks down into the one in the farthest corner, and I seat myself across from her. So gallant and thoughtful of the senators to test out all this new technology for the rest of us and make sure it's safe for use by all the little people.

I stare moodily out the window as we accelerate, glittering snowflakes flashing past for a moment before we duck down into the tunnels. I rode the tram a lot in another, half-forgotten life back in what was once Shrike's Harbor, from a dingy hovel on Peddler's Point to the towering scribal complex on the Tanglebrook and back every working day. I think if you'd told that idealistic girl that on the other side of her dream lay electric traction, regular schedules, shock absorbers, and a final end to the loud, obnoxious whuffling of the _şue phin_ that used to draw the coaches, she would have signed on with the Winter Suns years earlier and fought twice as hard.

As much as I know we're getting all our blueprints straight from the League, I can't help but be impressed at how far we've come so quickly.

The Senate building sits in the center of Destiny Garden. It's a majestic sight in springtime, its great circular stairs and high columns rising from a delicately landscaped expanse of softly colorful trees and flowers. Under a blanket of snow, its majesty becomes austere and forbidding. There's an honor guard outside but they don't disturb us as we enter; the building is, by constitutional commandment, a public space — albeit one sequestered in the most restricted district of the Republic.

There's a marble-tiled outer hall surrounding the inner sanctum. We attract more than a few curious gazes as I stride briskly from one entrance straight to another, Bear keeping pace just behind me, and Moose doing his best to keep Sparrow moving. I'm not gentle with the inner doors, and the echoing clatter as they crash open brings a tiny smile to the corner of my face, though Sparrow starts in alarm.

The Senate Chamber itself is a grand cylindrical room, with blue-and-white stone pillars holding up the high dome ceiling, through whose (bulletproof) glass light streams into the otherwise dark room. A few reporters are lurking on the sidelines in the observation ring; I don't even pause before beginning to climb the short flight of stairs up to the sacred platform. Thirty-eight women and men stand in the ring of frosty daylight, clad in flowing white robes with a single blue stripe around the waist. Among them stands the President on her low dais at the front of the room, her pure white robe of office shining in the light, accentuating her bright silver-pink hair and light ruddy skin. Amid the largely pureblood crowd, she stands out like a gently glowing red dwarf against the dark backdrop of the Void.

"—*do* forgive me, honored comrades, I'm afraid I must do us all the disrespect of momentarily interrupting our vivacious colleague's speech for a matter of the highest possible urgency—" The President's voice brings Landenbrook's nattering to a strangled halt, and Sparrow, taking a disbelieving look from the dais in the center of the platform back to me, looks like she's about to have an aneurysm.

"…she's the *president!?"* she almost squeals at me, barely keeping her voice to a whisper.

"'Fraid so," I tell her, not slowing my pace.

"How in all *fuck* could you let this happen?" I can't tell if she's more angry or confused. But she's now keeping pace with me without Moose's shoulder to lean on, so… probably angry. "I ain't *never* known you to roll over for no one like this, least of all *little wag-beak."*

"Honey," I whisper, patting her on the back, "I'm the one that gave her the job."

Her eyes widen. *"…fuck* me. Things really did go straight sideways after they came for Cor, din't they?"

I look away, shame abruptly suffusing my spirit. "…yeah," I murmur. "Yeah, they did."

"—friends—colleagues—comrades—I ask you to join me in welcoming to the hallowed Senate halls an officer whose name we all know and cherish, a woman whom our *glorious* nation owes the most profound of gratitude -- and of course, her esteemed guests!"

Applause, some of it wildly enthusiastic, some of it perfunctory and grudging, rings out as I step up onto the platform. Some of the senators bow or curtsey; a few, high-ranking military officers themselves, stand to attention and salute instead.

"Sounds like she wants to lick your clit," Sparrow murmurs in astonishment. "Who woulda guessed a bit of power was the way to her tattered little heart?"

"Ain't like that at all." I shake my head. "She's playing the suckup on account of she knows full well I can take her power away again if she gets uppity, is all."

Sparrow brightens considerably. "So when do you figure—"

*"I don't,"* I hiss, touching a finger to my lips in a warning gesture as we reach the dais. Egret reaches out to take my hand, something that anyone else would have easily mistaken for a smile on her face.

"Without further ado," the President concludes, leading me up onto the dais and holding our clasped hands momentarily above our heads for all to see, "I give you our Comrade Kestrel Winterblossom, General-for-Life of the Army, Heroine of the Republic, Defender of the People, and Soldier of the Revolution! I beseech you all to offer her your fullest and most solemn attention in regard to this crucial matter -- not simply because we all owe her that much and so very much more, but because our Comrade Kestrel is a relentless champion of the values that the Cormorant taught us, a fearless warrior for the voiceless and downtrodden, and the living conscience of this nation, without whom I fear we would go far astray." Inclining her head, she steps away and climbs down off the dais, taking up a position at a respectful distance with her hands clasped primly at her waist. *On your best behavior, Commander,* her narrow gaze warns louder than words.

I hold up a hand and the applause quickly dies down. "Senators, comrades, I thank you for so graciously allowing me a moment of your precious time. As always, I am humbled by your show of appreciation -- appreciation I indeed find myself showered with wherever I go, from the highest halls of state and most elite of social functions to the most unassuming of taverns and the fields of collective farms. Of course, I didn't get into the business of war and revolution in fanciful expectation of fame, glory, and prestige -- no soldier in her right mind would -- and it is thanks enough for my labor of love simply to walk down Stormvale's broad boulevards and breathe the free air of world we have built."

I look back and forth over the assembly of the thirty-eight senators. It's a mélange of highly distinct personalities, with little in common beyond their fervent assertions of ideological orthodoxy and the advanced age of most, with only a small handful being less than forty solar years. While even here there are occasional sparks of youthful idealism and naïveté to be found, on the whole, dealing with politicians isn't like dealing with soldiers.

"But instead I am so fortunate as to be received with far more than the simple comradely affection and respect I long dreamed my people would one day show one other -- to be received with eager smiles, needless yet sincere deference, and jubilant voices raised aloud to cry my name above the sound of the crowd. And it is this -- it is seeing the simple but heartfelt gratitude in the eyes of the everyday people -- that truly shows me every drop of blood I bled over the course of our long war, and all the sweat and pain I spent of thereafter, was well and truly worth it." Oh, who am I even trying to convince? The senators? Or myself? "It is because I am permitted to see in raw emotion what my efforts meant to so many people that I know with total conviction I would do it all over again without a moment's hesitation." At least lying to politicians doesn't feel nearly so heart-wrenchingly dishonorable as lying to soldiers. "And it is this that would grant me the strength to fight as long and as hard as my people needed of me." The ones still alive, anyway. "This -- not medals, not titles, not glory -- is the highest honor and greatest earthly reward any true soldier can attain."

When you're out in the field with a gaggle of battered and exhausted men still ten klicks from your objective and an ocean of blood yet to be spilled, there's a sort of purity to it, a simplicity. You worm your way into their jaded heads through whatever windows they've left open, you push their buttons, amp them up, tamp down their fear, remind them what they're fighting for. You tell them what motherfucking badasses they are even if they're the saddest excuse for a company you've seen yet, call them out by name and by deed, get them cheering each other's bravery. Then you whip up a little call-and-response patter to keep them shouting, lift them to a crescendo of confidence and adrenaline, wrap them tight in camaraderie, and they'll fall over themselves to be the first to follow you into the fire. If that formula fails you, you're either in a situation so hopeless Shuharva himself couldn't hack his way out of it, or you shouldn't be trusted with so much as telling bedtime stories to children.

Having my way with politicians -- that involved a bit of a learning curve.

I look down, clasping my hands behind my back. "Her Excellency, my old and admired colleague, the President of this Senate of the people, spoke of heroes and heroism. It is to precisely this subject that I wish to draw your attention -- not to heroes sung of in taverns and praised in the verses of our vaunted poets, but to those lost in the fog. Those who disappear into the cracks between the worlds and pass out of living memory as quickly as their deeds were great." I extend a hand towards Sparrow, who starts and stares up at me in alarm. "To a heroine whose sacrifices stand above mine like a mountain above a valley, all of them made in the name of her comrades, her people -- and our beloved Cormorant, may the stars sing her name forevermore. Whose total selflessness and unswerving bravery in the face of even the most fearsome foe humbled and inspired all around her." That part's all true, at least. Bear steps up behind Sparrow, gently but inexorably urging her forward toward me. "A heroine of the Revolution who embodiesd the highest virtues of our civilization." Bear gives me a look I know all too well -- *you are laying the bullshit on thick today, woman,* I can almost hear him say.

Sparrow, after repeated proddings, slowly and reluctantly steps forward, reaching out to take my hand. I tug gently, leading her up onto the dais with me, and she turns even paler, trembling like a leaf under the Senate's collective gaze. "Her name is Lieutenant Sparrow Fenwild," I continue, putting an arm around Sparrow's back to support and comfort her. "Commanding officer for the Third Infantry Company of the Ninth Battallion. She is a woman who has saved more lives in the thick of battle than you and I have all had hot dinners, *reckoned togetherwise.* Who would -- and did -- sooner throw herself in front of enemy bullets than see a single civilian wounded, to say nothing of her own women and men, who could not have had a leader more devoted to the cause -- and to bringing them home safe to their men, their women, their children at the end of it all. In the years I fought by Sparrow's side, I lost count of the number of people who are only alive today because she valiantly rescued them just in the nick of time. But it was well into the triple digits by the time I did.

"The Ninth had a reputation, among soldiers and every-day folk alike. We were the ones who got sent in when there were forces spinning helplessly in a suicide orbit who needed their ass hauled to higher ground before the sun of war melted the skin off their bones. We had a simple code: we never, *never* left a comrade behind, no matter the cost." So Birch put a bullet through his own head to make sure we wouldn't risk the whole city trying to save him. "Well, Sparrow was to the Ninth what we were to everyone else. She was the one always pulling our asses out of the fire while were too busy with other asses and other fires. She saved my life more than once, and the lives of nearly all my friends. So why have you all heard of me, and none of you have heard of this girl here?"

I scan the crowd again, this time making direct eye contact with the senators. They're quiet, attentive. Calculating, observing. Young Summerbough looks like she's struggling to hold back a salute. Sage Winter-Lily keeps glancing at her pocketwatch. Grace Sixth Glade's Charity, her senatorial robes marked over the shoulder with her service stripes, is watching with a quiet reverence, eyes far away.
