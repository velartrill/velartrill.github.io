"Ma'am, a word?"

Tirshad doesn't turn. Her attention remains fixed on the little glass slate in her hands, fingers darting back and forth across the screen as the last attendees file out of the room. "I assume you mean to explain yourself, comrade," she says, glancing up, momentarily meeting Seluen's gaze in the reflection. Her voice is light, not betraying irritation, but just cool enough that the expectation is clear.

Seluen clears her throat awkwardly. "Ah - no, ma'am. A question."

Tirshad slips the slate back into its receptacle, turning to face her, clasping her hands in front of her waist and raising her eyebrows. "Ask."

"Why did you bring it up?"

"Bring what up?"

Seluen sighs. "Don't be coy. Everyone hates it when you're coy."

"You mean the project. Why wouldn't I?"

Seluen looks up, right into her eyes. "Ma'am, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"

A note of confusion. "I'm… trying to perform my role, comrade. To defend the People?" Tirshad shakes her head, holds up her hands. "Okay. Cards on the table, _varan?_ I played along because I assumed you had some reason to play dumb, but I don't… understand what's going on here. Has there been some miscommunication? Do we need to talk… somewhere else?"

Seluen studies her expression intently for a moment, then steps back. "I think there might have been, yes," she says quietly before she looks back up at her superior, beckons.

Tirshad follows her through the archway out onto the balcony. Seluen's hair flutters in the cool ocean breeze as she leans on the railing, staring out into the sea. "Tell me how much of the night of the one-thirty-first you remember," Seluen says.

"Remember?" Tirshad sounds puzzled. "How much I—? Comrade, what are you…"

"Look, I know there was a lot of drink flowing. I'm not going to judge."

"O-oh." Tirshad's gaze drops; she squeezes her wrist awkwardly. "I'm… n-not a lot." Her voice is timid, uncharacteristically so.

"So you don't remember the conversation."

"Wh-what conversation?"

Seluen takes a deep breath, and turns to face her. She steps close, into Tirshad's personal space, and looks up at her, eyes soft and fearful.

*"Tiri,"* she says, touching a hand softly to Tirshad's chest. "I'm asking, okay? Not your subordinate. *Me."*

Tirshad blinks several times, then touches her on the shoulder, squeezing gently. "I'm not lying to you, Seli."

"So you really don't remember?"

"I don't. What—"

"So we're still—" Seluen bites her lip, looks away for a moment. "I'm sorry, I know this is— this is not professional of me, not in the slightest, I just… I need to know." She looks back up, eyes timid. "I need to know we're still okay."

Tirshad touches her cheek, leans in, kisses her tenderly on the lips. "Of course we are, Seli," she murmurs. "Why wouldn't we be? What happened?"

Seluen takes a moment to savor the kiss before sighing and stepping back. She looks up at Tirshad with newly cold eyes.

"Mirpan and Vaspash were both in the room when you brought it up. Neither of them have codeword clearance for SCIMITAR; neither of them have any business knowing we know it exists. It didnt help that Iurnus wasn't her usual voluble self, either. I thought it might have been a mistake; goodness knows we've all been under enough stress lately. Even Tirshad might slip up. Might."

She clasps her hands behind her back.

"Tirshad and I have never had a relationship." She clears her throat, voice breaking, emotion finally starting to leak through her restraint. "And I guess now we'll never have the chance to."

Tirshad blinks rapidly.

"What in Haven are you—"

"Don't. Just don't." Seluen turns away, waving her hand. "I can't. I honestly can't stomach it, watching you wear her like a goddamn *rancal.* Be an honorable woman or… whatever you are and show me your own goddamn face. You don't need to keep defiling the memory of someone I loved."

There's a pause. Then the world wavers. The gray of the sky brightens and the sun dims until it's just a placid, featureless white; the architecture of the complex dissolving away under her feet. The ocean breeze is the last to go, and Seluen flinches as it does. She looks down; her crisp black-and-white uniform has been replaced by a silky, sleeveless, seamless, skin-tight white garment that runs from her shoulders to her ankles.

She swallows hard, and looks up.

Where Tirshad had been standing is a… woman? unlike anything Seluen has seen outside of sketches and photographs. Her skin is black — not the dark skin of a pureblood robin, but the jet-black of empty space, with nebular patterns of rose and violet shimmering just beneath the surface. Her hairs streaks vividly between white and purple; her huge irises are the color of fresh lilac. She's wearing a similar garment, though hers is looser and flecked with red and gold. And she's… tall. Taller than humans should be able to be.

"Thank you," Seluen says quietly, exhaling. "What do you want me to call you?"

The woman inclines her head. "You may call me Nmeshirya."

"Nmeshirya, then." Seluen steps slowly closer. "Can I please just ask you something? Human to human — if there is a human soul inside you somewhere?"

The woman tents her fingers. "You may ask."

"Can we please be fucking adults here?" Seluen waves a hand bitterly. "I know where I am. I know what you are. I know what this is, and I know what you can do to me here. If you could erase my memories and start over you would have already. So the tricky shit is over. That means I either give you something you want or—" She squeezes her eyes shut for a moment, takes a deep breath. "We both know what happens. So let's try and find something that works for both of us."

"What leverage could you possibly have?" Nmeshirya replies gently. "You have nothing I cannot take away, little Green."

"Mmh-mh, no, no, that's not true." Seluen shakes her head firmly. "There are some kinds of intelligence even *you* can't get by torture. Trust me, I have a *lot* of firsthand experience. We go down that road and you go from coherent intel to splinters and fragments and a whole heap of lies to sift the truth out of. Sucks for you, mega-sucks for me, bad time all around. But there are things I can give you that will be valuable to you and won't seriously jeopardize the security of the People, things you can only get from cooperation and can then confirm on other sources. And there is a whole lot you can give me that doesn't mean jack shit to your crew. So let's negotiate." She licks her lips. "Please?"

The Thalisan's smile is amused. She tilts her head, stepping closer; Seluen feels briefly dizzy as the gravity beneath her suddenly cuts out and she's lifted bodily into the air, high enough to meet the Thalisan eye to eye. She gulps as the woman gestures and Seluen is dragged closer, floating helplessly in the air.

"What is it you want to know?" she asks.

Seluen takes a ragged breath, flushing with relief. "O-okay. Okay, um. I… I just want to know, I… is she, is Tirshad…" She shakes her head violently, trying to reorganize her scattering thoughts. "I know you captured her too. You were copying her too perfectly. The only way you could know all that is if you spent a good long time talking to her yourself. So tell me what you've done to her. Tell me if she's still alive. Please tell me she's still alive."

Nmeshirya regards her for a moment. "That depends on what you mean by 'alive.'"

"…oh no. No, no, no—"

"We found your bodies floating in an asteroid field. Your survey ship was compromised; as far as we can reconstruct, a high-velocity impact by a micrometeor or fossil munition disrupted your drive core moments before you shifted away. The mis-shift ripped your craft apart; bits and pieces of it are scattered across a cone oh-point-three parsecs long. You and everyone else aboard suffocated shortly afterwards." The woman's voice softens slightly. "Your neural architecture is impressive. A baseline could not have endured thirty-six hours of brain death and expect to be recovered remotely intact. You endured forty-nine. Your body was torn to pieces; your spinal cord was detached from its housing."

Seluen's hyperventilating. "No… no no *no,* no, that's— how am— how is this, how are we—"

"Your brain and spinal cord were sufficiently intact to preserve. I innervated your remains and began the process of resuscitation. Damaged native neurons have been salvaged and replaced with high-fidelity biosimulators; probabilistic reconstruction methods have restored approximately ninety-nine point nine six eight of your neural connections, only eighty-seven percent of which were fully intact at the time you were found. Your brain currently exists in a hybrid state of native wetware interoperating with nonnative wetware, hardware, and external software."

"I'm just a copy?" Seluen whispers hollowly. "The real me has already passed on?"

"You are not a copy," Nmeshirya returns gently. "You are a reconstruction. There is a distinction. The soul is a wavefunction, not a solid stone in the hand — like an electron forced to choose the way of least resistance, the path it has taken is not always collapsed and determined at any given point in time. Our resuscitation efforts were like reconnecting a wire. Were your soul flown onward, attempts to reconstruct your damaged memories would have resulted in noise and you would be a simple automaton, a subsentient artificiality. That you remain conscious demonstrates you are not."

Seluen closes her eyes, her soldier's instincts finally breaking through and forcing her to fight the panic. *This is not a nightmare. You are awake and the People are in danger. Focus.*

"And… and Tirshad—" She has to fight her body — or the simulacrum of her body — to make the words come out, she's so terrified to ask. "Is she… is her…"

"Her soul is likewise intact. Not all of your crew were so fortunate, but many were, the two of you included."

The relief that washes over Seluen feels physical, even if she knows it isn't. "Okay. Okay. Thank fuck, okay, thank *fuck.*" She feels momentarily dizzy, taking few moments to collect herself before she speaks to Nmeshirya again.

"When you finish interrogating us…" Hesitantly, she meets the Thalisan's eyes. "Are you just going to shut us off?"

"Yes." Nmeshirya watches the flash of despair pass through Seluen's eyes, then adds, "that is the protocol, anyway. But you have already broken us from that protocol."

"So there's a way we don't have to die?"

"I could give you a new life. Here in the *mpare.* I could let you be with your Tirshad again, give the two of you a comfortable place along that seaside you so love, *if* you decide to be cooperative in the long-term."

Seluen sighs. "If we betray the People, spend the rest of… however long we live, as your consultants, then we'd get to be your prisoners, your… pets in a dream-world where we're completely powerless, never getting to walk among the People again."

"Is that an option not preferable to death?"

Seluen closes her eyes, tears trickling down her cheeks. "It's really not." She shakes her head. "I'm… I'm ready to make my offer now."

"And that is?"

"Let me say goodbye to her. The real her. Have a few hours, maybe a day or so if you're feeling kind, to wind down and find some closure. In return I'll give you as much as I can give you on Codeword SCIMITAR without jeopardizing our defense. The state of our theories and knowledge of its means of operation. That's more than you have and it's more than you'd get from me by torture. You can cross-ref against other prisoners, and when it's time for us to go, you let us go hand-in-hand." She wipes the tears from her eyes with a trembling hand. "As comrades."

Nmeshirya sighs, and rolls her eyes. "Really? *Really?* Boring. Boooor*ing*. Back to plan A." Her irises flare and she reaches out a hand, Seluen arching her back and letting out a pitiful scream as her body rises higher into the air, shafts of golden light shining out of her skin like spears of plasma. The pain is unlike anything she's ever known, anything she's ever imagined; it feels like every single nerve left in her body simultaneously went supernova. "This is so much more fun than talking, anyway," Nmeshirya begins, a savage grin on her lips—

—then stops.

"Naughty, *naughty."*

Suddenly there's another woman standing next to her. Shorter, with sharp, spiky white hair and vivid purple eyes. She glances up at Seluen and snaps her fingers, and the pain is gone just as quickly as it came, like turning off a light. Seluen hangs there, gasping and panting, watching in disbelief as the Echoes face off.

_"Chare— sharo de—"_ Nmeshirya backs away, hands curling into a fighting posture, staring at the silver-haired woman wildly.

_"Marenyeshta Qarashqirai Ménmasakai thaluan de,"_ the woman responds briskly. She casually flicks her fingers downwards. _"Naka diri."_

Nmeshirya staggers, crying out in pain, the light in her eyes flickering out. The smaller woman clenches a fist, and as her hand moves Nmeshirya is propelled bodily into the air, still wailing with pain. Silver-hair makes a final remark and snaps her fingers. Nmeshirya is gone.

Silver-hair turns back to Seluen, and with a wave of her hand Seluen feels gravity reassert itself, bringing her gently back down to whatever passes for a floor in this simulation. "I am so sorry for the inconvenience," she says in stilted Khmaira, approaching Seluen and inclining her head. "On behalf of the Supreme Conclave, please accept my heartfelt apology for your mistreatment."

*"What the fuck just happened?"* Seluen blurts, still trembling from the brief moment of torture. "Who the fuck are you!?"

"Oh, thank Khata'e, a common tongue." The woman extends a hand. "Marenyeshta Qarashqira Ménmasakai, Thaluan of the First Circle by special appointment of the Conclave and former Special Envoy to the Saravan Coordination Council. And you are Seluen Pantiri Casrani, yes?"

"Y-y-yes, I'm— what is going *on?"*

"One moment; I'd like to just explain this the once." Another finger-snap and suddenly they're in a cozy little office, a fire roaring in a fireplace, a massive gas giant rising in the night sky out the window. Tirshad is sitting on a short grey couch; as the scene resolves she sits up straight and looks around wildly. Seluen lets out an involuntary cry of relief.

"Tirshad Pantiri Casrani, Thaluan Marenyeshta," Marenyeshta says quickly, offering the startled Green a hand. "Forgive the abrupt change of scenery, I needed to connect you with your colleague."

"Tiri!" Seluen blurts, rushing forward, grabbing Tirshad by the shoulder. "Stars and skies, is it really you?"

"Is it really *you?"* Tirshad returns suspiciously, narrowing her eyes. "The last thing I remember I was trapped in some goddamn Echo's virch hell—"

"You have my sincere apologies for the emotional and physical discomfort you have both endured, and those of the Conclave."

"Where the fuck are we?"

"My old office on Saravan, after a fashion. Still off in the ether, I'm afraid; neither of you are in any condition to have a conversation ‘in the flesh,’ if you'll forgive the crude imagery." Marenyeshta holds up a bottle. "Drink? It's only as alcoholic as you want it to be."

"I-I'll pass, thank you," Tirshad stammers. "What in all Haven is going *on,* woman!?" She motions for Seluen to sit beside her; Seluen reflexively obeys. 

"Yes, that." Marenyeshta winces, sitting on her desk and clasping her hands, the liquor bottle dissolving away into nothing. "Quite an unfortunate business all around. I'll give you the short version — you had the misfortune to crash a spy ship where one of our less scrupulous citizens found your remains, and I'm afraid you were dragged into some internal intrigue."

"Internal… what?"

"I'll put it this way: you nosy foreigners aren't the only people with undue interests in the military secrets of the Free." Marenyeshta sighs. "We now believe Nmeshikarya Koroshqetai Niqamandai — our mutual acquaintance — is the mastermind of a series of etheric attacks and sector-sweeping operations that the First Circle has been tracking for the past seven cycles, trying to dig up intelligence on the weapon that was used to carry out the Carnelian Geocide. We have no idea what her motives were but we'll find out soon enough." Marenyeshta's eyes darken for a moment. "The woman is a bumbling child compared to a *real* interrogator."

"…I never thought I'd hear a fucking Echo use the phrase 'Carnelian Geocide,'" Tirshad murmurs.

Marenyeshta's face hardens. "Perhaps this will surprise you, mortal, but the Free look no more fondly on our ancestors' war crimes than you do yours." She holds up a hand and an image appears in midair, a solar map with two pulsating icons drawing closer and closer together. "Fortunately for everyone concerned, we were able to trace a recent attack back to Nmeshikarya's physical presence. My ship is in-system and currently burning towards your position; I will arrive in approximately thirty-seven Carnelian minutes to complete my arrest and begin cleanup. Nmeshikarya's spirit has been sequestered from afar; she is of no further threat to you or anyone else."

Tirshad feels a hand on her thigh, glances down to see Seluen hesitantly resting her palm there. At Tirshad's look she starts to pull away, but Tirshad puts her hand atop Seluen's and squeezes tightly.

"What becomes of us?" she asks, looking back up at the Thalisan, no trace of fear in her voice.

"Yes, that." The star map is snuffed out. "Nmeshikarya was telling the truth about your physical forms, I'm afraid to say. Given the extraordinary circumstances, I've been authorized to offer you a permanent placement in the spirit realm; we could in effect uplift you into the *mpare* post-mortem, on an even footing with many natural citizens who've chosen a purely spiritual existence. I don't know if your culture has a concept of heaven but it's the closest you'll find outside a Khmai myth."

The two women are silent for a moment.

"So we can't go home?" Tirshad asks dully.

"…you want to go *back?"* Marenyeshta asks, blinking in surprise.

"That's all I fucking want anymore," Seluen mumbles, resting her head on Tirshad's shoulder. Tirshad squeezes her hand, nods.

"To that… dreary, mortal existence in the totalitarian hell you call Tel Casran?"

"Much, much more than I want to spend the rest of eternity locked up inside a goddamn computer." Tirshad glares at her. "That 'totalitarian hell' is our *comrades,* Echo."

"…well." Marenyeshta tugs on her robes as if to straighten them. "I'm… I suppose I could arrange something, grow you new bodies, perhaps."

"You can do that?" Seluen exclaims, finally feeling her first real spark of hope.

"If you insist." She waves a hand dismissively. "It'll take a week or two, but I'll see that you're kept comfortable in the meantime. How do you want the new bodies to look? New eye color, taller, firmer tits, different genitals—?"

*"Green* eyes, please, and I'll thank you *very* kindly to leave my *genitals* the hell alone," Tirshad growls, leaning forward. "If I wake up without a cunt it will mean *war,* you have my solemn oath."

Marenyeshta holds up her hands. "Alright! Alright! I can see you're very attached to your consensus forms. I'll try to model them to your ego-projections here; we can always touch up the details later—"

"—um," Seluen says.

"Yes?"

"Could, um." She turns bright red as Tirshad stares at her. "Actually, um, firmer tits would… would feel pretty nice, actually?" She glances at Tirshad. "If… if that's okay."

"What in Haven business is it of mine what you do with your bod—" Tirshad begins, then stops. Then her face flushes faintly. "…oh."

"Y-yeah."

"I… that's… that's your decision to make and I'll support you either way?" Tirshad murmurs uncertainly. "I'm… I'm sorry, Selue— Seli, I had no idea."

"It's okay, I'm— I just— I thought— I didn't want— y-you probably don't even—"

Tirshad puts an arm around her, pulling her close and squeezing her tight.

"If…" . "Is… even just in theory, is there a way we could have real bodies again? Or are we just… digital ghosts?"

"You are neither digital nor ghosts. Your consciousness remains earthed in a physical substrate. Regardless." Nmeshirya nods. "Yes. If I wished it so I could in time provision you with physical forms again."
