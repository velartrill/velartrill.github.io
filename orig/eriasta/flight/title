description: "The hoary old Protectorate of Seprena, home to mad inventors, sadistic slave-drivers, and half the gold of the Continent, is facing a crisis unlike any before in its history. A fanatical and intolerant faith that spits in the face of the old gods is sweeping ever westward, rapidly devouring the power of the ancient patrician families by clever use of the nation's working people and their long-simmering resentments. Alone, desperate, fleeing the iron fist of Prophet Kelaune, apprentice healer Seri Imaela is about to get in way over her head."
