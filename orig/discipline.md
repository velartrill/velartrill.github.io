# The People's Discipline

"Atten-*tion!"*

Startled by the call, we're all a little disorganized leaping to our feet from the breakfast table and forming into line. One poor man knocks over his bowl; I see him flinch as a guard notices and makes a note on her slate. Heart pounding, I find a spot at the end of the line and clasp my trembling hands behind my back. A Green officer surveys us with cold eyes.

Unlike the rest, she's not wearing a helm and her mouth isn't by the concealing mesh all the others in the hall are wearing — something I've learned in the year and a half I've been here is a sure sign of authority.

She surveys us, eyes moving from one to the next, doubtless in search of some failure of posture or wrinkling of uniforms to punish. Finding none, she lifts her slate.

"When your number is called, step forward."

I restrain a sigh, keeping my eyes fixed straight ahead. This ritual always feels like a dagger through the chest, but there's nothing for it but to follow orders and hope it's over soon. As usual.

"Prisoner six-two-six-eight-one."

A man salutes, steps forward, unable to conceal the relief in his eyes. The guard nods to him. "About-face. Prisoner six-two-three-two nine."

This time, a woman I know — at least, as much as you can know anyone when you're flogged every time you try and speak to them. For the month they spent near starving me after I was brought in, she'd slip me food at mealtimes whenever she could. She's Kaparttu like me, one of only a few here — this place is going to feel all that more cold and alienating without her.

"Prisoner six-three-oh-twelve-ten."

*What.*

I'm so surprised that I freeze up for a split second before I'm able to urge my legs forward, nearly stumbling across the line. The officer gives me an irritated look before motioning for me to turn and face the other inmates.

*How is this happening.*

"If your sponsor has petitioned under this moon and your name has not been called," the officer concludes, "your petition is rejected. You may petition again once this lunar month concludes; your counselor will explain reasons for your rejection and what actions you can take to improve your chance of acceptance next moon." This time, I feel slightly giddy at the feeling of restraints behind strapped around my wrists — this might just be the last time, ever. "To those of your number who have made this courageous step forward towards comradeship under the banner of a new nation, offer your salutes."

Bitterly, the remaining inmates raise their hands to their brows, index and middle fingers straight in that strange salute the Greens use. Armored hands close around my upper arms; my muscles go almost instinctively limp in their grip. We're led out of the mess hall, down long hallways and past a number of checkpoints before they split us up.

This is a part of the facility I haven't seen before. Much of the dark, sterile metal has been traded in for light wooden panelling, with even flowers here and there. There's fewer guns, fewer guards — the Greens here are dressed in form-fitting robes, not armor, most carrying slates or paperwork. I swallow hard as we stop before a room; one of the officers leading me presses the access panel and green light flashes from the doorway as the door unlocks.

Mirsil is sitting on a metal folding chair on the other side; she rises to her feet, eyes brightening as she sees me. "Clare!" she calls out as the officers lead me inside. I feel tears burning in the corner of my eyes, unable to hold back a smile. The officers remove my restraints; Mirsi hugs me tightly as soon as they step back. I'm almost afraid to hug her back, afraid I'll be flogged if I move my hands from behind my back without permission — but I force myself to anyway.

"You… you *filed for me—?"* I whisper.

"I wasn't sure— I didn't want to get your hopes up, Clarity—"

I rest my head on her shoulder. "Thank you. God, *thank you."*

The officers don't interfere with the reunion, watching from a respectful distance. After Mirsi reluctantly lets go of me, ruffling my hair as she steps back, an officer clears his throat and says something to her in Ranuir.

_"Han, han; coshvin."_ She takes me by the shoulder and turns me around, unfastening my prisoner-of-war uniform and tugging the top up over my shoulders. I look away from the officers, my cheeks burning as she undresses me — I don't know how the Greens can think so *little* of nudity.

Mirsi fits a soft, plain pink gown over my shoulders, completing the little ritual, and I exhale. One of the officers opens up a small paper folio. "These are your identity documents," he says to me in awkward Zia Ţai. "Per the Provisional Code, you are required to carry your Civil Identity card with you at all times." He shows me a black-and-green card with my intake photo watermarked at the top. "The CI card contains galvanic workings, so do not bend or fold it as that may damage its circuitry."

He returns it to the folio and pulls out another card, this one black with pink text. "As a probationary releasee, you are also required to carry your prisoner of war identity card," he continues. "You will be required to carry this card until such time as you are granted citizenship and your brand is voided." He taps the back of his neck; I flinch. "You must present these cards whenever you are asked by a uniformed officer of the Provisional Government, including any uniformed officer of Society Expeditionary Force 'Scarlet.' Failure to do so is a civil infraction and may result in brief confinement and corporal punishment, though it is not ground for cancellation of release."

He slips the cards back into the folio and hands it to me; I take it gingerly, feeling like I've just been handed serious contraband. "The folio also contains your release paperwork and further information on the terms of your release; it is translated into Zia Ţai, Khmaira, and Kapagirwe. Are you fluent in at least one of those tongues?"

"Y-yes, sir."

"Excellent. Any questions?"

I want to ask about my old Imperial passbook — but I know I'm not getting it back, and asking would only get me in trouble. I bite my tongue and shake my head instead.

The officer nods, and squeezes me gently on the shoulder, startling me. "Congratulations, comrade," he says, in a suddenly warm voice. "I hope  the peaceful new life we can offer you under socialism is better than your life as a Rosie conscript, and I wish you the best of luck with your rehabilitation. You are hereby discharged into the care and authority of—" He glances at his slate. "—Comrade Mirsil Sersishi Sehueri of the People."

"Th-thank you, sir," I stutter. I can't see his lips under the black mesh of his helmet but the way his eyes crease suggest he's smiling.

_"Ari vara sheno messe, Mirsil-surin,"_ he tells Mirsi, who smiles and nods.

_"E-elen vine, san. Hante."_

With that, the officers depart, leaving the door ajar behind them. Mirsi hugs me again as soon as they're gone; I can feel her shivering with giddiness in my arms.

"What'd he tell you?" I ask, my voice muffled by her body.

She kisses me on the forehead. "He just said, 'take care of her, comrade,'" she says, voice trembling a bit. I can't help but blush. "I told him I would, 'cause I'm gonna."
