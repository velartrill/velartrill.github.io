		<h1>School Plagiarism License</h1>
		<div class="byline">by alexis summer hale, author of and rights-holder to all content on this website</div>
		<p style="font-style: italic">i present the following policy not because i expect many readers of my site will take advantage of it, but in hopes that other web designers and writers might adopt this policy as well. the text of this page is released into the public domain and under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a> license. feel free to take and modify for your own use as you see fit (i would appreciate a link, but it's not obligatory). if you do however, please <strong>modify your robots.txt to block the turnitin.com crawler</strong>.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>plagiarism, often described as an “academic crime,” is the act of taking another person’s work and presenting it as one’s own. most schools, at least in the united states, take a very strong stance against plagiarism and make use of automated tools to detect content that may have been taken verbatim from or that overly resembles content catalogued by their web crawlers.</p>
		<p>as someone who was herself deeply traumatized by the American school system and has known many other victims of similar trauma, i feel very strongly that absolutely nobody should feel obligated to play by its rules. nobody should be invested in their report cards, nobody should give a damn what their teachers or administrators think of them, and nobody should take their schooling remotely seriously. if you are currently trapped in the American school system — or any abusive school system anywhere in the world — your only concern should be getting out alive.</p>
		<p>you should feel no obligation to obey any academic authority figure, teacher, principal, or superintendant. you should feel no guilt for “cheating” a fundamentally dishonest, manipulative, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_institution">totalizing institution</a>, and you should only care about your grades insofar as they have an impact on the life you hope to build outside of school. middle school kids: your grades have <strong>no</strong> impact on that life, and don’t let any parent or teacher make you think otherwise. </p>
		<p><strong>therefore,</strong> i give you full permission and encouragement to take and use any portion of this site and present it, without crediting me, as your own creation, provided the following criteria are met:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>you are a student no older than age 20 attending a primary or secondary school under the coercion of a state, parent, guardian, or any other public or private entity (the possibility of legal penalties or loss of opportunity for refusing to attend school shall be deemed "coercion" for the purpose of this clause)</li>
			<li>the content you copy from this website and present as your own will not be exposed to anyone who does not attend, teach at, or administer your school in some capacity</li>
		</ol>

		<p>my <a href="/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> has blocked turnitin.com from indexing my site from the beginning, and it always will. anything copied from this sife <em>should</em> be safe to submit or include in your work. <strong>please note however that while i have taken every possible measure to make my work safe to plagiarize, this DOES NOT MEAN you will not face potentially severe consequences if caught</strong> — nothing in this license will keep teachers and principals from punishing you, so exercise discretion and make sure to change any wording that doesn't sound like you. teachers are known for googling lines that seem out of place, and this website <strong>is</strong> indexed by Google. but for the record, if you are a teacher or administrator and you intend to punish a student for plagiarizing this site, you are doing to in direct and total contradiction to the wishes and intent of the author.</p>
